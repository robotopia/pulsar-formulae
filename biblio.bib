The effect is particularly strong close to the light cylinder, but also affects the field close to the stellar surface. We find the shape and locus of the field lines which just close at the light cylinder. Their footpoints define the pulsar polar cap. We find this cap is asymmetric and distorted. We also find that the polar cap is not strongly elliptical. This result disagrees with calculations based on the non-rotating dipole field. We present our numerical results, and discuss consequences for interpretation of mean profiles and for pulsar statistics.},

abstract = {We derive the dispersion relations and polarization characteristics of the normal modes of radiation in superstrong magnetic fields, with particular attention to those attributes of importance to the transfer of radiation in the relativistic electron-positron plasmas expected to occur in the magnetospheres of radio pulsars. We restrict ourselves to the regions where the proper frequency of cyclotron resonance greatly exceeds the proper frequencies of the radiative normal modes. The normal modes are derived when the plasma has no momentum dispersion across the magnetic field but has arbitrary momentum dispersion along the field. The contribution of displacement current to the propagation of these "hydromagnetic" waves is consistently included. The distinction between superluminous and subluminous modes is made in the superstrong regime, where drift motions across the field are negligible, and useful formulae for the Landau damping of the subluminous branch of ordinary mode (the Alfven wave) are derived. These are used to set observational constraints on the geometry of the emission zone in radio pulsars, if the emission mechanism generates radiation in the form of subluminous waves. A brief discussion is given of the relevance of nonvacuum propagation to Razin suppression of bunched coherent curvature emission.},

Pulse  profiles were recorded at four frequencies in the range 0.4-1.64 GHz,  yielding topocentric pulse arrival times with uncertainties of order  10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} periods. Models fitted to the timing data yield accurate  positions, periods, period derivatives, and dispersion measures for each  pulsar. Nine of the measured period derivatives are new, and most of the  parameters represent improvements upon previous measurements. In a few  cases we correct some erroneous parameter values from the published  literature. A glitch was observed in the PSR B1800-21 pulse arrival  times, and we fit a simple exponential model to the post-glitch  recovery. We present graphs of the observed pulse shapes and their  evolution with frequency, a table of measured pulse widths, and  quantitative estimates of the long-term timing stability of each pulsar.},

This study has led to the identification of a stable system of subbeams circulating around the magnetic axis of this star. Here, we present a single-pulse analysis of our observations of this pulsar at 35 MHz. The fluctuation properties seen at this low frequency, as well as our independent estimates of the number of subbeams required and their circulation time, agree remarkably well with the reported behavior at higher frequencies.

abstract = {GENERAL features of the short term variations in pulsars are remarkably steady. It has been found1, for example, that PSRs 1919 + 21 and 2016 + 28 (AP2015) exhibit a marching subpulse phenomenon, and this effect has since been detected in other pulsars. Other pulsars such as PSRs 0950 + 08 and 1929 + 10 show no such obvious correlation from pulse to pulse, but do have characteristic statistical properties on the same time-scale. Pulsar 0950 + 08 is very erratic, often showing 100 per cent modulation of the pulse energy over a single pulse period. On the other hand, 1929 + 10 has a pulse to pulse modulation of only 50 per cent with the exception of null pulses2 which recur regularly. Thus the characteristic short-term variations are an additional steady parameter of each pulsar which deserves to be considered along with the period, pulse shape, polarization properties and spectrum as a property of the source. The short-term variations of PSR 1237 + 25 have been described in detail in two earlier papers2,3. This communication describes a peculiar change of mode that occurs infrequently in sequences of pulses from 1237 + 25.},

abstract = {We report analysis of an 8 hr observation of PSR B0943+10 at 325 MHz performed at the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in India. B0943+10 is well known for displaying regular sub-pulse drifting and two emission modes. We investigate the modal behavior of B0943+10. By reconstructing an entire 'B' mode from two consecutive 'B' modes, we estimate that the pulsar spends roughly 7.5 hrs in the 'B' mode and about 2.2 hrs in the 'Q' mode, on average. Although the pulsar can switch modes within one pulse, the sub-pulse drift rate changes with a characteristic time of 1.2 hrs over the course of a 'B' mode. Under the subbeam carousel model we find the drift-rate changes are produced by a 10{\%} increase in the average number of subbeams and a 16{\%} increase in the carousel circulation time. We speculate that under the partially screened gap model the increase in circulation time should be related to a small increase in the neutron star surface temperature.},

abstract = {The FORS1 instrument on the ESO Very Large Telescope was used to obtain low-resolution circular polarised spectra of nearly a thousand different stars, with the aim of measuring their mean longitudinal magnetic fields. A catalogue of FORS1 magnetic measurements would provide a valuable resource with which to better understand the strengths and limitations of this instrument and of similar low-dispersion, Cassegrain spectropolarimeters. However, FORS1 data reduction has been carried out by a number of different groups using a variety of reduction and analysis techniques. Our understanding of the instrument and our data reduction techniques have both improved over time. A full re-analysis of FORS1 archive data using a consistent and fully documented algorithm would optimise the accuracy and usefulness of a catalogue of field measurements. Based on the ESO FORS pipeline, we have developed a semi-automatic procedure for magnetic field determinations, which includes self-consistent checks for field detection reliability. We have applied our procedure to the full content of circular spectropolarimetric measurements of the FORS1 archive. We have produced a catalogue of spectro-polarimetric observations and magnetic field measurements for about 1400 observations of about 850 different objects. The spectral type of each object has been accurately classified. We have also been able to test different methods for data reduction is a systematic way. The resulting catalogue has been used to produce an estimator for an upper limit to the uncertainty in a field strength measurement of an early type star as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio of the observation. While FORS1 is not necessarily an optimal instrument for the discovery of weak magnetic fields, it is very useful for the systematic study of larger fields, such as those found in Ap/Bp stars and in white dwarfs.},

abstract = {The study of pulsars in the three and a half decades since their  discovery has highlighted a handful of issues critical to their  understanding. To date there is no consensus on the physical mechanism  for their radio emission, despite a rapid increase in the observed  population due to the Parkes multi-beam survey and prospects for similar  growth in the radio population database in the near future. The small  subset of pulsars that emit at X-ray to gamma-ray wavelengths is  critical to refining the pulsar paradigm, since this energy band (i) is  where the vast majority of radiative luminosity is observed and (ii) is  intimately connected to the pair winds that form the dominant mode of  energy deposition in the circum-pulsar environment. The most crucial  point of contention pertaining to the high energy astrophysics of  pulsars is the location of the acceleration region in their  magnetospheres: is an outer gap model or a polar cap scenario (or both)  the most appropriate picture. Radiative signatures provide the clues to  this current enigma. This review focuses on salient characteristics of  the polar cap scenario; these form the basis for discriminating  observational diagnostics that should drive pulsars studies in the GLAST  era just three years away.},

abstract = {The propagation of waves through a relativistically outflowing electron-positron plasma in a very strong dipolar magnetic field, conditions expected in pulsar magnetospheres, is investigated. Halmilton's equations is derived for the propagation of rays through a plasma which is inhomogeneous in density, magnetic field directions, and Lorentz factor. These equations are solved for rays propagating through the plasmas outflowing along the 'open' dipolar field lines in which the density decreases inversely as the radius cubed and in the case where gradients transverse to the radial direction exist. In the radial case, the effects of refraction on pulse profiles, spectrum, and polarization are examined, and the effects of a transverse gradient are indicated. Attention is given to models in which the observed broad bandwidth in the radio emission has its origin in a radius to frequency map. Models with broad-band emission at a single radius are also studied. These are compared to observations of pulse width and pulse component separation as a function of frequency. The origin of 'orthogonal modes' is discussed.},

abstract = {A large sample of pulsars was observed as part of the Meterwavelength Single-pulse Polarimetric Emission Survey. We carried out a detailed fluctuation spectral analysis that revealed periodic features in 46{\%} of pulsars, including 22 pulsars where drifting characteristics were reported for the first time. The pulsar population can be categorized into three distinct groups: pulsars that show systematic drift motion within the pulse window, pulsars showing no systematic drift but periodic amplitude fluctuation, and pulsars with no periodic variations. We discovered the dependence of the drifting phenomenon on the spin-down energy loss (E ˙), with the three categories occupying distinctly different regions along the E ˙ axis. The estimation of the drift periodicity (P3) from the peak frequency in the fluctuation spectra is ambiguous due to the aliasing effect. However, using basic physical arguments we were able to determine P3 in pulsars showing systematic drift motion. The estimated P3 values in these pulsars were anti-correlated with E ˙, which favored the partially screened gap model of the inner acceleration region in pulsars.},

abstract = {We have produced a new software package for the simulation of pulsar populations, $\backslash$textsc{\{}PsrPopPy{\}}, based on the $\backslash$textsc{\{}Psrpop{\}} package. The codebase has been re-written in Python (save for some external libraries, which remain in their native Fortran), utilising the object-oriented features of the language, and improving the modularity of the code. Pre-written scripts are provided for running the simulations in `standard' modes of operation, but the code is flexible enough to support the writing of personalised scripts. The modular structure also makes the addition of experimental features (such as new models for period or luminosity distributions) more straightforward than with the previous code. We also discuss potential additions to the modelling capabilities of the software. Finally, we demonstrate some potential applications of the code; first, using results of surveys at different observing frequencies, we find pulsar spectral indices are best fit by a normal distribution with mean {\$}-1.4{\$} and standard deviation {\$}1.0{\$}. Second, we model pulsar spin evolution to calculate the best-fit for a relationship between a pulsar's luminosity and spin parameters. We used the code to replicate the analysis of Faucher-Gigu$\backslash$`ere {\&} Kaspi, and have subsequently optimized their power-law dependence of radio luminosity, {\$}L{\$}, with period, {\$}P{\$}, and period derivative, {\$}\backslashdot{\{}P{\}}{\$}. We find that the underlying population is best described by {\$}L \backslashpropto P{\^{}}{\{}-1.39 \backslashpm 0.09{\}} \backslashdot{\{}P{\}}{\^{}}{\{}0.48 \backslashpm 0.04{\}}{\$} and is very similar to that found for {\$}\backslashgamma{\$}-ray pulsars by Perera et al. Using this relationship, we generate a model population and examine the age-luminosity relation for the entire pulsar population, which may be measurable after future large-scale surveys with the Square Kilometer Array.},

On the one hand, within a few years it became clear that neutron star rotation gives rise to the extremely stable sequence of radio pulses, that the kinetic energy of rotation provides the reservoir of energy, and that electromagnetic fields are the braking mechanism. On the other hand, no consensus regarding the mechanism of coherent radio emission or the conversion of electromagnetic energy to particle energy yet exists. In this review, we report on three aspects of pulsar structure that have seen recent progress: the self-consistent theory of the magnetosphere of an oblique magnetic rotator; the location, geometry, and optics of radio emission; and evolution of the angle between spin and magnetic axes. These allow us to take the next step in understanding the physical nature of the pulsar activity.},

abstract = {We revisit the phenomenon of pulse nulling using high-quality single-pulse data of PSR B1133+16 from simultaneous multifrequency observations. Observations were made at 325, 610, 1400 and 4850 MHz as part of a joint program between the European Pulsar Network and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The pulse energy time series are analysed to derive improved statistics of nulling pulses as well as to investigate the frequency dependence of the phenomenon. The pulsar is observed to be in null state for approximately 15{\%} of the time; however, we find that nulling does not always occur simultaneously at all four frequencies of observation. We characterise this "selective nulling'' as a function of frequency, separation in frequency, and combination of frequencies. The most remarkable case is a significantly large number of nulls ({\$}\backslashapprox{\$}6{\%}) at lower frequencies, that are marked by the presence of a fairly narrow emission feature at the highest frequency of 4850 MHz. We refer to these as "low frequency (LF) nulls." Our analysis shows that this high frequency emission tends to occur preferentially over a narrow range in longitude and with pulse widths typically of the order of a few milliseconds. We discuss the implications of our results for the pulsar emission mechanism in general and for the broadbandness of nulling phenomenon in particular. Our results signify the presence of an additional process of emission which does not turn off when the pulsar nulls at low frequencies, and becomes more prominent at higher frequencies. Our analysis also hints at a possible outer gap origin for this new population of pulses, and thus a likely connection to some high-energy emission processes that occur in the outer parts of the pulsar magnetosphere.},

abstract = {We have made observations of 98 low-Galactic-latitude pulsars to measure pulse broadening caused by multipath propagation through the interstellar medium. Data were collected with the 305-m Arecibo telescope at four radio frequencies between 430 and 2380 MHz. We used a CLEAN-based algorithm to deconvolve interstellar pulse broadening from the measured pulse shapes. We employed two distinct pulse broadening functions (PBFs): PBF{\$}{\_}1{\$} is appropriate for a thin screen of scattering material between the Earth and a pulsar, while PBF{\$}{\_}2{\$} is appropriate for scattering material uniformly distributed along the line of sight from the Earth to a pulsar. We found that some observations were better fit by PBF{\$}{\_}1{\$} and some by PBF{\$}{\_}2{\$}. Pulse broadening times ({\$}\backslashtau{\_}d{\$}) are derived from fits of PBFs to the data, and are compared with the predictions of a smoothed model of the Galactic electron distribution. Several lines of sight show excess broadening, which we model as clumps of high density scattering material. A global analysis of all available data finds that the pulse broadening scales with frequency, {\$}\backslashnu{\$}, as {\$}\backslashtaud \backslashpropto\backslashnu{\^{}}{\{}-\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} where {\$}\backslashalpha\backslashsim 3.9\backslashpm 0.2{\$}. This is somewhat shallower than the value {\$}\backslashalpha=4.4{\$} expected from a Kolmogorov medium, but could arise if the spectrum of turbulence has an inner cutoff at {\$}\backslashsim {\$}300--800 km. A few objects follow particularly shallow scaling laws (the mean scaling index {\$}\backslashmeanalpha \backslashsim 3.1 \backslashpm 0.1{\$} and {\$} \backslashsim 3.8 \backslashpm 0.2{\$} respectively for the case of PBF{\$}{\_}1{\$} and PBF{\$}{\_}2{\$}), which may arise from large scale refraction or from the truncation of scattering screens transverse to the Earth--pulsar line of sight.},

abstract = {Multipath propagation in the interstellar medium distorts radio pulses, an effect predominant for distant pulsars observed at low frequencies. Typically, broadened pulses are analyzed to determine the amount of propagation-induced pulse broadening but with little interest in determining the undistorted pulse shapes. In this paper, we develop and apply a method that recovers both the intrinsic pulse shape and the pulse-broadening function that describes the scattering of an impulse. The method resembles the CLEAN algorithm used in synthesis imaging applications, although we search for the best pulse-broadening function and perform a true deconvolution to recover intrinsic pulse structure. As figures of merit to optimize the deconvolution, we use the positivity and symmetry of the deconvolved result along with the mean square residual and the number of points below a given threshold. Our method makes no prior assumptions about the intrinsic pulse shape and can be used for a range of scattering functions for the interstellar medium. It can therefore be applied to a wider variety of measured pulse shapes and degrees of scattering than the previous approaches. We apply the technique to both simulated data and data from Arecibo observations.},

abstract = {Studying the gravitational-wave sky with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is a key science goal for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its pathfinder telescopes. With current PTAs reaching sub-microsecond timing precision, making accurate measurements of interstellar propagation effects and mitigating them effectively has become increasingly important to realise PTA goals. As these effects are much stronger at longer wavelengths, low-frequency observations are most appealing for characterizing the interstellar medium (ISM) along the sight lines toward PTA pulsars. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Engineering Development Array (EDA), which utilizes MWA technologies, present promising opportunities for undertaking such studies, particularly for PTA pulsars located in the southern sky. Such pulsars are also the prime targets for PTA efforts planned with the South African MeerKAT, and eventually with the SKA. In this paper we report on observations of two bright southern millisecond pulsars PSRs J0437-4715 and J2145-0750 made with these facilities; MWA observations sampling multiple frequencies across the 80-250 MHz frequency range, while the EDA providing direct-sampled baseband data to yield a large instantaneous usable bandwidth of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}200 MHz. Using these observations, we investigate various aspects relating to pulsar emission and ISM properties, such as spectral evolution of the mean pulse shape, scintillation as a function of frequency, chromaticity in interstellar dispersion, and flux density spectra at low frequencies. Systematic and regular monitoring observations will help ascertain the role of low-frequency measurements in PTA experiments, while simultaneously providing a detailed characterization of the ISM toward the pulsars, which will be useful in devising optimal observing strategies for future PTA experiments.},

abstract = {We report long-term scintillation observations of 18 pulsars in the dispersion measure range 3-35 pc cm-3 carried out from 1993 January to 1995 August using the Ooty Radio Telescope at 327 MHz. These observations were made with the aim of studying refractive effects in pulsar scintillation and obtaining reliable estimates of diffractive and refractive scintillation properties. Dynamic scintillation spectra of pulsars were regularly monitored at 10-90 epochs spanning 100-1000 days. Significant changes are observed in the dynamic spectra over timescales as short as a few days. Large-amplitude fluctuations are observed in quantities such as decorrelation bandwidth, scintillation timescale, drift rate, and flux density. Several pulsars show organized features, such as drifting bands in a highly pronounced manner. For some pulsars, gradual and systematic variations are seen in the drift rate of patterns that undergo several sign reversals during the observing time spans. Anomalous behavior, such as persistent drifts lasting over many months, is seen for PSRs B0834+06 and B1919+21. Four pulsars were studied for 2-4 well-separated observing sessions, each lasting over {\~{}}100 days. In some cases, significant variations are seen in the average scintillation properties and/or flux densities between successive observing sessions. From our data, we have been able to obtain more accurate and reliable estimates of scintillation properties and flux densities than those from the earlier observations by averaging out the fluctuations due to refractive scintillation effects. These measurements are used to derive parameters such as the strength of scattering and scintillation speeds. The scintillation speed estimates are found to be reasonably good indicators of proper-motion speeds of pulsars. The present measurements are compared with earlier measurements and the long-term stability of scintillation properties and flux densities is discussed.},

abstract = {We report new results obtained from multifrequency observations of PSR B0826-34 with the Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope (GMRT). (1) We find no evidence of weak emission during the typical long null state of this pulsar, simultaneously at 303 and 610 MHz, as well as individually at 157, 325, 610 and 1060 MHz at separate epochs. Our limit of non-detection is at 1 per cent or better of the peak of the active state profile, and corresponds to 2 mJy at 610 MHz. (2) Significant correlation in the total intensity of the individual pulses between 303 and 610 MHz is reported from the simultaneous dual-frequency observations, which is indicative of the broad-band nature of the emission. We also report correlation between total energy in the main pulse and interpulse region from the high-sensitivity single-frequency observations at 610 and 1060 MHz. (3) Though we find the drift pattern to be very similar in the simultaneous 303- and 610-MHz data, we observe that the drift band separation (P2) evolves significantly between these two frequencies, and in a manner opposite to the average profile evolution. In addition, we confirm the dependence of P2 on pulse longitude at 303 MHz and find indications for the same at 610 MHz. We also present results for subpulse width ([Delta][Phi]s) at different frequencies, and as well as a function of pulse longitude. (4) As a natural outcome of the simultaneous dual-frequency observations, we obtain an accurate dispersion measure value, equal to 52.2(6) pc cm-3, for this pulsar. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {We report the discovery of a remarkable subpulse drift pattern in the  relatively less-studied wide profile pulsar B0818-41 using  high-sensitivity Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations. We  find simultaneous occurrences of three drift regions with two different  drift rates: an inner region with steeper apparent drift rate flanked on  each side by a region of slower apparent drift rate. Furthermore, these  closely spaced drift bands always maintain a constant phase  relationship. Though these drift regions have significantly different  values for the measured P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, the measured P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} value  is the same and equal to 18.3P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We interpret the unique  drift pattern of this pulsar as being created by the intersection of our  line of sight (LOS) with two conal rings on the polar cap of a fairly  aligned rotator (inclination angle alpha {\~{}} 11∞), with an `inner'  LOS geometry (impact angle ). We argue that both rings have the same  values for the carousel rotation periodicity P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and the  number of sparks N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sp{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We find that N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sp{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is 19-21  and show that it is very likely that P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is the same as the  measured P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, making it a truly unique pulsar. We present  results from simulations of the radiation pattern using the inferred  parameters, which support our interpretations and reproduce the average  profile as well as the observed features in the drift pattern quite  well.},

abstract = {PSR B0818-41 is one of the few pulsars which show multiple drift regions having well defined phase relationship. In this paper we report new results from the multifrequency GMRT observations of this pulsar. Significant linear polarization is observed with depolarization at the edge of the profile, due to orthogonal polarization. Circular polarization changes sign near the middle of the pulse profile at 1060 MHz, but not observed at 325 and 610 MHz. Remarkable frequency evolution of polarization angle (PA) is observed. Based on the frequency evolution of average profile, PA swing and results from subpulse drifting, we propose two possible emission geometries, alpha{\~{}}11 deg, beta{\~{}}-5.4 deg and alpha{\~{}}175.4 deg, beta{\~{}}-6.9 deg. Simulation of the pulsar radiation pattern with both these geometries reproduces the observed features in the drift pattern quite well. In addition to the remarkable subpulse drifting observed at 325 MHz, we report subpulse drifting at 244 and 610 MHz. We observe changes of drift rates, transitions from negative to stationary and stationary to negative drift rates, with some connection with nulls. Though P3m is the same for all the drift regions, P2m and Delta(Phi) values are different for the inner and outer drift regions. The peak emission from the leading and the trailing outer regions are offset by {\~{}} 9 P1. Utilising this information, we solve the aliasing problem and predict P4{\~{}} 10 s, which makes it the fastest known carousel. The drift pattern from the two rings are phase locked for PSR B0818-41. The same is found to be true for, all pulsars showing drifting in multiple rings of emission and puts constraints on the theoretical models of pulsar emission mechanism and, favors a pan magnetospeheric radiation mechanism.},

abstract = {We report on the unique nulling properties of PSR B0818-41, using the GMRT at 325 and 610 MHz. We find following interesting behaviour just before and after the nulls: (i) The pulsar's intensity does not switch off abruptly at the null, but fades gradually, taking {\~{}} 10 P1. Just after nulls intensity rises to a maximum over a short (less than one period) time scale. (ii) While the last active pulses before nulls are dimmer, the first few active pulses just after nulls outshine normal ones. This effect is very clear for inner region of pulsar profile, where mean intensity of last few active pulses just after nulls is {\~{}} 2.8 times more than that for last active pulses just before nulls. (iii) There is a significant evolution of shape of the pulsar's profile, around nulls, especially at beginning of bursts: an enhanced bump of intensity in inner region, a change in ratio of strengths of the leading and trailing peaks towards a more symmetric profile, an increase in profile width of about 10{\%}, and a shift of profile centre towards later longitudes. (iv) Just before nulls, the apparent drift rate becomes slower, transitioning to an almost phase stationary drift pattern. Further, when the pulsar comes out of null, the increased intensity is very often accompanied by what looks like a disturbed drift rate behaviour, which settles down to the regular drift pattern as the pulsar intensity returns to normal. Thus, we find some very specific and well correlated changes in the radio emission properties of PSR B0818-41 when the emission restarts after a null. These could imply that the phenomenon of nulling is associated with some kind of a "reset" of the pulsar radio emission engine. We also present plausible explanations for some of the observed behaviour, using the Partially Screened Gap model of the inner pulsar accelerator.},

abstract = {Observations of individual pulses from PSR 0826-34 at 645 MHz show subpulses at all longitudes. The integrated pulse profile is very wide and possesses a strong interpulse which leads the midpoint of the main double pulse by about 150° of longitude. A remarkable pattern of drifting subpulses occurs across nearly 200° of longitude, with typically five drift bands present. The drift rate shows wide variations including sign reversals, but no significant variations in the secondary period (P2) were observed. The character of integrated pulse polarization profiles at 408 and 610 MHz and the width of the integrated pulse profile are consistent with a nearly aligned rotator emission geometry with possible elongation of the emission beam. Current proposals for the drifting subpulse mechanism do not adequately describe the observed drifting subpulse behaviour.},

Their properties, and those of the average pulse profile, are consistent with an emission geometry in which the magnetic and rotation axes are nearly orthogonal. That is, we are observing both magnetic poles of this pulsar. A correlation between emission from the two magnetic poles was found wherein a strong interpulse is followed by a strong main pulse. We discuss possible agencies for this one-way communication between the magnetic poles. Also, the main pulse appears to undergo mode changes that are primarily characterized by a change in peak flux density of component I.},

abstract = {The rotating vector model of pulsar polarization of Radhakrishnan and Cooke (1969) is extended here to include first-order special relativistic effects. The model predicts that the centroid of the position angle curve arrives later than the centroid of the intensity profile by 4r/c, where r is the emission radius. Application of the model to pulsars with well ordered position-angle swings and periods between 0.06 and 3.7 s give emission radii of not more than 2000 km for 0.43 and 1.4 GHz. Symmetry-breaking effects of the corotation velocity may help explain a general asymmetry found in pulsar intensity profiles and may strongly affect the intensity profiles of short-period pulsars.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of peculiar X-ray spectral variability in the binary radio millisecond pulsar PSR J0024--7204W in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. The observed emission consists of a dominant non-thermal component, which is eclipsed for a portion of the orbit, and a thermal component, which appears to be persistent. We propose that the non-thermal X-rays originate in a relativistic intrabinary shock, formed due to interaction between the relativistic particle wind from the pulsar and matter from the main-sequence companion star, while the thermal photons are from the heated magnetic polar caps of the millisecond pulsar. At optical wavelengths, the emission exhibits large-amplitude variations at the orbital period, which can be attributed to heating of one side of the tidally-locked secondary star by the pulsar wind. The observed X-ray and optical properties of PSR J0024--7204W are remarkably similar to those of the low mass X-ray binary and X-ray millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4--3658 in quiescence. This supports the conjecture that the non-thermal X-ray emission and optical modulations seen in the SAX J1808.4--3658 system in a quiescent state are due to interaction between the wind from a reactivated rotation-powered pulsar and matter from the companion star. The striking similarities between the two systems provide support for the long-sought connection between millisecond radio pulsars and accreting neutron star systems.},

The X-ray emission of the majority of these MSPs is well described by a thermal (blackbody or neutron star hydrogen atmosphere) spectrum with a temperature {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}\backslashsim(1-3)\backslashtimes10{\^{}}6{\$} K, emission radius {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}\backslashsim0.1-3{\$} km, and luminosity {\$}L{\_}{\{}X{\}}\backslashsim10{\^{}}{\{}30-31{\}}{\$} ergs s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. For several MSPs, there is indication that a second thermal component is required, similar to what is seen in some nearby field MSPs. The radio-eclipsing binary MSPs 47 Tuc J, O, and W show a significant non-thermal component, with photon index {\$}\backslashGamma\backslashsim 1-1.5{\$}, which may originate in an shock formed due to interaction between the relativistic pulsar wind and matter from the stellar companion. We re-examine the X-ray--spindown luminosity relation ({\$}L{\_}{\{}X{\}}-\backslashdot{\{}E{\}}{\$}) and find that due to the large uncertainties in both parameters the result is consistent with both the linear {\$}L{\_}{\{}X{\}}-\backslashdot{\{}E{\}}{\$} relation and the flatter {\$}L{\_}X\backslashpropto\backslashdot{\{}E{\}}{\^{}}{\{}0.5{\}}{\$} predicted by polar cap heating models.

abstract = {Here we present an in-depth study of the behaviour of the Fast Folding Algorithm, an alternative pulsar searching technique to the Fast Fourier Transform. Weaknesses in the Fast Fourier Transform, including a susceptibility to red noise, leave it insensitive to pulsars with long rotational periods (P {\textgreater} 1 s). This sensitivity gap has the potential to bias our understanding of the period distribution of the pulsar population. The Fast Folding Algorithm, a time-domain based pulsar searching technique, has the potential to overcome some of these biases. Modern distributed-computing frameworks now allow for the application of this algorithm to all-sky blind pulsar surveys for the first time. However, many aspects of the behaviour of this search technique remain poorly understood, including its responsiveness to variations in pulse shape and the presence of red noise. Using a custom CPU-based implementation of the Fast Folding Algorithm, ffancy, we have conducted an in-depth study into the behaviour of the Fast Folding Algorithm in both an ideal, white noise regime as well as a trial on observational data from the HTRU-S Low Latitude pulsar survey, including a comparison to the behaviour of the Fast Fourier Transform. We are able to both confirm and expand upon earlier studies that demonstrate the ability of the Fast Folding Algorithm to outperform the Fast Fourier Transform under ideal white noise conditions, and demonstrate a significant improvement in sensitivity to long-period pulsars in real observational data through the use of the Fast Folding Algorithm.},

abstract = {We present results from our 830 ksec observation of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae with the Chandra X-ray Observatory's High Resolution Camera-S. We limit our analysis here to the 19 previously known, localized millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the cluster. This work more than doubles the sample of X-ray-detected MSPs observed with sensitivity to rotational variability; it is also the first survey of a large group of radio-discovered MSPs for which no previous X-ray pulsations have been detected and is therefore an unbiased survey of the X-ray properties of radio-discovered MSPs. We find that only 47 Tuc D, O and R show significant pulsations at the {\textgreater}{\~{}} 4-sigma level, but there is statistical evidence for rotational variability in five additional MSPs. Furthermore, we constrain the pulsed magnetospheric emission of 7 more MSPs using Monte Carlo simulations. The result is that the majority of the 47 Tuc MSPs are characterized by low pulsed fractions, {\textless}{\~{}} 50{\%}. In cases where larger pulsed fractions are measured the folded pulse profiles show relatively large duty cycles. When considered with previous spectroscopic studies, this suggests that the X-ray emission arises from the neutron star's heated polar caps, and in some cases, from intra-binary shocks, but generally not directly from the star's magnetosphere. We discuss the impact of these results on our understanding of high energy emission from MSPs.},

We have searched the data for relatively short orbital period systems, and found one pulsar with an orbital period of 96 min, the shortest of any known radio pulsar. The increased rate of detections with the new system resulted in improved estimates of the flux density of the previously known pulsars, determination of the orbital parameters of one of them, and a coherent timing solution for another one.

abstract = {IT has been shown by Bothe and others that beryllium when bombarded by $\alpha$-particles of polonium emits a radiation of great penetrating power, which has an absorption coefficient in lead of about 0.3 (cm.)-1. Recently Mme. Curie-Joliot and M. Joliot found, when measuring the ionisation produced by this beryllium radiation in a vessel with a thin window, that the ionisation increased when matter containing hydrogen was placed in front of the window. The effect appeared to be due to the ejection of protons with velocities up to a maximum of nearly 3 × 109 cm. per sec. They suggested that the transference of energy to the proton was by a process similar to the Compton effect, and estimated that the beryllium radiation had a quantum energy of 50 × 106 electron volts.},

abstract = {Pair Instability Supernovae have been suggested as candidates for some Super Luminous Supernovae, such as SN 2007bi, and as one of the dominant types of explosion occurring in the early Universe from massive, zero-metallicity Population III stars. The progenitors of such events can be rapidly rotating, therefore exhibiting different evolutionary properties due to the effects of rotationally-induced mixing and mass-loss. Proper identification of such events requires rigorous radiation hydrodynamics and radiative transfer calculations that capture not only the behavior of the light curve but also the spectral evolution of these events. We present radiation hydrodynamics and radiation transport calculations for 90-300 Msun rotating pair-instability supernovae covering both the shock break-out and late light curve phases. We also investigate cases of different initial metallicity and rotation rate to determine the impact of these parameters on the detailed spectral characteristics of these events. In agreement with recent results on non-rotating pair instability supernovae, we find that for a range of progenitor masses and rotation rates these events have intrinsically red colors in contradiction with observations of super-luminous supernovae. The spectroscopic properties of rotating pair instability supernovae are similar to those of non-rotating events with stripped hydrogen and helium envelopes. We find that the progenitor metallicity and rotation rate properties are erased after the explosion and cannot be identified in the resulting model spectra. It is the combined effects of pre-supernova mass-loss and the basic properties of the supernova ejecta such as mass, temperature and velocity that have the most direct impact in the model spectra of pair instability supernovae.},

abstract = {Numerical studies of primordial star formation suggest that the first stars in the universe may have been very massive. Stellar models indicate that non-rotating Population III stars with initial masses of 140-260 Msun die as highly energetic pair-instability supernovae. We present new two-dimensional simulations of primordial pair-instability supernovae done with the CASTRO code. Our simulations begin at earlier times than previous multidimensional models, at the onset of core collapse, to capture any dynamical instabilities that may be seeded by collapse and explosive burning. Such instabilities could enhance explosive yields by mixing hot ash with fuel, thereby accelerating nuclear burning, and affect the spectra of the supernova by dredging up heavy elements from greater depths in the star at early times. Our grid of models includes both blue supergiants and red supergiants over the range in progenitor mass expected for these events. We find that fluid instabilities driven by oxygen and helium burning arise at the upper and lower boundaries of the oxygen shell {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 20 - 100 seconds after core bounce. Instabilities driven by burning freeze out after the SN shock exits the helium core. As the shock later propagates through the hydrogen envelope, a strong reverse shock forms that drives the growth of Rayleigh--Taylor instabilities. In red supergiant progenitors, the amplitudes of these instabilities are sufficient to mix the supernova ejecta.},

These special pulsars must contain extremely ultrarelativistic particle accelerators. In this paper the authors consider the origin and structure of particle accelerators in the outer magnetosphere of pulsars characterized by large spindown energy loss rates. The discussion is concerned with the class of (mainly young) pulsars which can sustain pair production in otherwise charge-depleted regions of the outer magnetosphere. The resulting electrostatic accelerating region ("gap") is expected to exist far from the neutron star, where a corotating magnetosphere would be rotating at speeds a significant fraction of c. The size and location of this gap supports the production of energetic radiation beams of quite different character from the usual coherent microwave emission of radio pulsars.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional pulsar magnetosphere model is used to study the geometry of outer magnetospheric gap accelerators, following seminal work of Romani and coworkers. The size of the outer gap is self-consistently limited by pair production from collisions of thermal photons from polar cap heating of backflow outer gap current with curvature photons emitted by gap-accelerated charged particles. In principle, there could be two topologically disconnected outer gaps. Conditions for local pair production such as local field line curvature, soft X-ray density, electric field, etc., support pair production inside an outer gap only between rin($\phi$) (the radius of the null surface at azimuthal angle $\phi$) and rlim($\phi$){\~{}}6rin($\phi$=0){\textless}{\textless}RL (the light cylinder radius). Secondary pairs, on the other hand, are produced almost everywhere outside the outer gap by collisions between curvature photons and synchrotron X-rays emitted by these secondary pairs. These processes produce a wide X-ray fan beam in the outgoing direction and a very narrow beam in the incoming direction for each outer gap. For pulsars with a large magnetic dipole inclination angle, part of the incoming $\gamma$-ray beam will be absorbed by the stellar magnetic field. If the surface magnetic field is dominated by a far off-center dipole moment (e.g., as in a proposed ``plate tectonic'' model), gravitational bending of photons from polar cap accelerators and their ultimate conversion into outflowing e+/- pairs can result in the quenching of one of these two outer gaps. Various emission morphologies for the pulsar (depending on magnetic inclination angle and viewing angle) are presented. Double-peak light curves with strong bridges are most common. From the three-dimensional structure of the outer gap and its local properties, we calculate phase-resolved spectra of gamma-ray pulsars and apply them to observed spectra of the Crab pulsar.},

We use Bayesian methods to explore constraints on the mean and standard deviation of the luminosity function, as well as the total number of pulsars, given an observed sample of pulsars down to some limiting flux density, accounting for measurements of flux densities of individual pulsars as well as diffuse emission from the direction of the cluster. We apply our analysis to Terzan 5, 47 Tucanae and M 28, and demonstrate, under reasonable assumptions, that the number of potentially observable pulsars should be within 95{\%} credible intervals of {\$}147{\^{}}{\{}+112{\}}{\_}{\{}-65{\}}{\$}, {\$}83{\^{}}{\{}+54{\}}{\_}{\{}-35{\}}{\$} and {\$}100{\^{}}{\{}+91{\}}{\_}{\{}-52{\}}{\$}, respectively. Beaming considerations would increase the true population size by approximately a factor of two. Using non-informative priors, however, the constraints are not tight due to the paucity and quality of flux density measurements. Future cluster pulsar discoveries and improved flux density measurements would allow this method to be used to more accurately constrain the luminosity function, and to compare the luminosity function between different clusters.},

abstract = {In this article, we revisit the gamma-ray emission observed from millisecond pulsars and globular clusters. Based on 5.6 years of data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, we report gamma-ray spectra for 61 millisecond pulsars, finding most to be well fit by a power-law with an exponential cutoff, producing to a spectral peak near {\~{}}1-2 GeV (in {\$}E{\^{}}2 dN/dE{\$} units). Additionally, while most globular clusters exhibit a similar spectral shape, we identify a few with significantly softer spectra. We also determine the gamma-ray luminosity function of millisecond pulsars using the population found in the nearby field of the Milky Way, and within the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. We find that the gamma-ray emission observed from globular clusters is dominated by a relatively small number of bright millisecond pulsars, and that low-luminosity pulsars account for only a small fraction of the total flux. Our results also suggest that the gamma-ray emission from millisecond pulsars is more isotropic and less strongly beamed than the emission at X-ray wavelengths. Furthermore, the observed distribution of apparent gamma-ray efficiencies provides support for the slot gap or the outer gap models over those in which the gamma-ray emission originates from regions close to the neutron star's magnetic poles (polar cap models).},

abstract = {We use detailed nucleosynthesis calculations and a realistic prescription for the environment of the first stars to explore the first episodes of chemical enrichment that occurred during the dark ages. Based on these calculations, we propose a novel explanation for the increased prevalence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars with decreasing Fe abundance: The observed chemistry for the most metal-poor Galactic halo stars is the result of an intimate link between the explosions of the first stars and their host minihalo's ability to retain its gas. Specifically, high-energy supernovae produce a near solar ratio of C/Fe, but are effective in evacuating the gas from their host minihalo, thereby suppressing the formation of a second generation of stars. On the other hand, minihalos that host low-energy supernovae are able to retain their gas and form a second stellar generation but, as a result, the second stars are born with a supersolar ratio of C/Fe. Our models are able to accurately reproduce the observed distributions of [C/Fe] and [Fe/H], as well as the fraction of CEMP stars relative to non-CEMP stars as a function of [Fe/H] without any free parameters. We propose that the present lack of chemical evidence for very massive stars ({\textgreater}140 Msun), that ended their lives as a highly energetic pair-instability supernova, does not imply that such stars were rare or did not exist; the chemical products of these very massive first stars may have escaped from their host minihalo, and were never incorporated into subsequent generations of stars. Finally, our models suggest that the most Fe-poor stars currently known may have seen the enrichment from a small multiple of metal-free stars, and need not have been exclusively enriched by a solitary first star. These calculations support the idea that some of the surviving dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way are relics of the first galaxies.},

abstract = {An investigation is conducted concerning the intensity and polarization variations from PSR 2020+28. The investigation has the objective to gain insight into the possible determinants of polarization transitions. Polarization over the range of time scales from 8 microseconds to several years is studied. Particular attention is devoted to correlations with intensity of the position angle. Orthogonal modes are described as accurately as possible in the hope that the underlying mechanisms can be discerned. PSR 2020+28 was selected for detailed study because of its high polarization, both circular and linear, and because the modality phenomenon appeared to play a particularly constitutive role in its intrapulse structure. It is found that radiation is emitted by the pulsar as an admixture of two orthogonal modes of polarization.},

The authors combine new measurements of interstellar scintillation bandwidths and pulse broadening times with those from the literature to yield information on 76 lines of sight. For individual objects, the scaling of scintillation bandwidth with frequency is in agreement with a Kolmogorov spectrum. The study of all objects, however, indicates strong disagreement with a model in which turbulence is uniformly distributed. The data suggest a two-component model for electron density turbulence: (1) a clumped medium with scale height H ⪉ 100 pc; (2) a nearly uniform medium with H ⪆ 0.5 kpc. Scattering material is ubiquitous but is preferentially located near regions of large energy input into the interstellar medium.},

After reviewing the salient features of pulsar radiation, a number of issues are confronted, including (1) whether coherence is broadband or narrowband and, accordingly, (2) whether the emission frequency is mapped into radius and/or magnetic polar angle; and (3) whether pulse structure (micropulses and subpulses) represents angular or temporal structure. It is proposed that pulse nulling, mode changing, and quantized drift rates for subpulses are related to discrete states of the particle flow in polar cap models.},

Pulsar radio emission is a textbook example of this signal class, known as cyclostationary signals. In this paper, we discuss the application of cyclic spectral analysis methods to pulsar data, and compare the results with the traditional filterbank approaches used for almost all pulsar observations to date. In contrast to standard methods, the cyclic spectrum preserves phase information of the radio signal. This feature allows us to determine the impulse response of the interstellar medium and the intrinsic, unscattered pulse profile directly from a single observation. We illustrate these new analysis techniques using real data from an observation of the millisecond pulsar B1937+21.},

abstract = {The ``drifting'' subpulses exhibited by some radio pulsars have fascinated both observers and theorists for 30 years, and have been widely regarded as one of the most critical and potentially insightful aspects of their emission. Here, we report on detailed studies of pulsar B0943+10, whose nearly coherent sequences of ``drifting'' subpulses have permitted us to identify their origin as a system of subbeams that appear to circulate around the star's magnetic axis. We introduce several new techniques of analysis, and we find that both the primary and secondary features in the star's fluctuation spectra are aliases of their actual values. We have also developed a method of tracing the underlying pattern responsible for the observed sequences, using a ``cartographic'' transform and its inverse, permitting us to study the characteristics of the polar-cap emission ``map'' and to confirm that such a ``map'' in turn represents the observed sequence. We apply these techniques to the study of three different Arecibo observations. The ``B''-mode sequences are consistent in revealing that the emission pattern consists of 20 subbeams, which rotate around the magnetic axis in about 37 periods or 41 seconds. Even in the ``Q'' mode sequence, we find evidence of a compatible circulation time. The similarity of the subbeam patterns at different radio frequencies strongly suggests that the radiation is produced within a set of columns, which extend from close to the stellar surface up though the emission region and reflect some manner of a ``seeding''phenomenon at their base. The subbeam emission is then tied neither to the stellar surface nor to the field.},

abstract = {The beautiful sequences of drifting subpulses observed in some radio pulsars have been regarded as among the most salient and potentially instructive characteristics of their emission, not least because they have appeared to represent a system of subbeams in motion within the emission zone of the star. Numerous studies of these drift sequences have been published, and a model of their generation and motion was articulated long ago by Ruderman {\&} Sutherland; but thus far, efforts have failed to establish an illuminating connection between the drift phenomenon and the actual sites of radio emission. Through a detailed analysis of a nearly coherent sequence of drifting pulses from the pulsar B0943+10, we have in fact identified a system of subbeams circulating around the magnetic axis of the star. A mapping technique, involving a cartographic transform and its inverse, permits us to study the character of the polar cap emission map and then to confirm that it, in turn, represents the observed pulse sequence. On this basis, we have been able to trace the physical origin of the drifting subpulse emission to a stably rotating and remarkably organized configuration of emission columns, in turn traceable possibly to the magnetic polar cap gap region envisioned by some theories.},

abstract = {We present the influence of the special relativistic effects of aberration and light travel time delay on pulsar high-energy lightcurves and polarization characteristics predicted by three models: the two-pole caustic model, the outer gap model, and the polar cap model. Position angle curves and degree of polarization are calculated for the models and compared with the optical data on the Crab pulsar. The relative positions of peaks in gamma-ray and radio lightcurves are discussed in detail for the models. We find that the two-pole caustic model can reproduce qualitatively the optical polarization characteristics of the Crab pulsar - fast swings of the position angle and minima in polarization degree associated with both peaks. The anticorrelation between the observed flux and the polarization degree (observed in the optical band also for B0656+14) naturally results from the caustic nature of the peaks which are produced in the model due to the superposition of radiation from many different altitudes, ie. polarized at different angles. The two-pole caustic model also provides an acceptable interpretation of the main features in the Crab's radio profile. Neither the outer gap model nor the polar cap model are able to reproduce the optical polarization data on the Crab. Although the outer gap model is very successful in reproducing the relative positions of gamma-ray and radio peaks in pulse profiles, it can reproduce the high-energy lightcurves only when photon emission from regions very close to the light cylinder is included.},

abstract = {We present a modification of the relativistic phase shift method of determining the radio emission geometry from pulsar magnetospheres proposed by Gangadhara {\&} Gupta (2001). Our modification provides a method of determining radio emission altitudes which does not depend on the viewing geometry and does not require polarization measurements. We suggest application of the method to the outer edges of averaged radio pulse profiles to identify magnetic field lines associated with the edges of the pulse and, thereby, to test the geometric method based on the measurement of the pulse width at the lowest intensity level. We show that another relativistic method proposed by Blaskiewicz et al. (1991) provides upper limits for emission altitudes associated with the outer edges of pulse profiles. A comparison of these limits with the altitudes determined with the geometric method may be used to probe the importance of rotational distortions of magnetic field and refraction effects in the pulsar magnetosphere. We provide a comprehensive discussion of the assumptions used in the relativistic methods.},

I present a simple and short derivation of this delay-radius relation to show that it is not caused by the aberration (understood as the normal beaming effect) but purely by contribution of corotation to the electron acceleration in the observer's frame. Available altitude-dependent formulae for the PA curve are expressed through observables and emission altitude to make them immediately ready to use in radio data modelling. The analytical approximations for the altitude-dependent PA curve are compared with exact numerical results to show how they perform at large emission altitudes. I also discuss several possible explanations for the opposite-than-normal shift of PA curve, exhibited by the pedestal emission of B1929+10 and B0950+08.},

abstract = {Polarisation of radio pulsar profiles involves a number of poorly understood, intriguing phenomena, such as the existence of comparable amounts of orthogonal polarisation modes (OPMs), strong distortions of polarisation angle (PA) curves into shapes inconsistent with the rotating vector model (RVM), and the strong circular polarisation V which can be maximum (instead of zero) at the OPM jumps. It is shown that the existence of comparable OPMs and of the large V results from a coherent addition of phase-delayed waves in natural propagation modes, which are produced by an incident linearly polarised signal. The coherent mode summation implies opposite polarisation properties to those known from the incoherent case, in particular, the OPM jumps occur at peaks of V , whereas V changes sign at a maximum of the linear polarisation fraction L/I. These features are indispensable to interpret various observed polarisation effects. It is shown that statistical properties of the emission mechanism and of propagation effects can be efficiently parametrised in a simple model of coherent mode addition, which is successfully applied to complex polarisation phenomena, such as the stepwise PA curve of PSR B1913+16 and the strong distortions of the PA curve within core components of pulsars B1933+16 and B1237+25. The inclusion of coherent mode addition opens the possibility for a number of new polarisation effects, such as inversion of relative modal strength, twin minima in L/I coincident with peaks in V , 45 deg PA jumps in weakly polarised emission, and loop-shaped core PA distortions. The empirical treatment of the coherency of mode addition makes it possible to advance the understanding of pulsar polarisation beyond the RVM model.},

abstract = {Taxonomy of radio pulsar profiles is mostly based on a system of Ptolemaic artificiality, consisting of separated rings and a core, arbitrarily located at disparate altitudes in the magnetosphere. Diversity of observed profile shapes clearly exceeds the interpretive capability of such conal model. Moreover, bifurcated features observed in pulsar profiles imply a system of fan beams radially extending away from the dipole axis. The bifurcations can be understood as the imprint of the elementary radiation pattern of the long-sought radio emission mechanism, thus identifying the latter. Their size, however, is several times larger than implied by the curvature of magnetic dipole lines. Here I show that the illusion of disconnected rings and the size of bifurcated features can be explained through a natural geometry which combines the properties of both the cone and the fan beam. It is a flaring spiral which makes several revolutions around the dipole axis on its way to leave the magnetosphere. Such geometry is consistent with a stream of outflowing and laterally drifting plasma. The bifurcated components are so wide, because the curvature on such a spiral is larger than that of the dipolar magnetic field, hence they are consistent with the extraordinary mode curvature radiation.},

abstract = {We present the model of eclipsing a rotating, spatially extended source of directional emission by a central absorber, and apply it to the pulsar magnetosphere. The model assumes the radially extended inward radio emission along the local direction of the magnetic field, and the pulsar as the absorber. The geometry of the magnetic field lines of the rotating dipole is favourable for the double eclipse events, which we identify with the double notches observed in pulse profiles of nearby pulsars. For pulsars with large dipole inclinations 70 {\textless}{\~{}} alpha {\textless}{\~{}} 110 deg the double notches are predicted to occur within a narrow phase range of 20 to 30 deg before the main radio peak. Application of the model to PSR B0950+08 establishes it as a nearly orthogonal rotator (alpha ={\~{}} 75 deg, beta ={\~{}} -10 deg) with many pulse components naturally interpreted in terms of the inward radio emission from a large range of altitudes. The inward components include the intermittently strong, leading component of the main pulse, which would traditionally have been interpeted as a conal emission in the outward direction. The model also identifies the magnetic field lines along which the radially extended inward radio emission occurs in B0950+08. These have a narrow range of the footprint parameter s close to 1.1 (closed field line region, near the last open field lines). We describe directional characteristics of inward emission from the radially extended region and compare them with characteristics of extended outward emission. Our work shows that pulse profiles of at least some pulsars may be a superposition of both inward and outward emission.},

abstract = {The known population of pulsars contains objects with four and five component profiles, for which the peak-to-peak separations between the inner and outer components can be measured. These Q and M type profiles can be interpreted as a result of sightline cut through a nested cone beam, or through a set of azimuthal fan beams. We show that the ratio R{\_}W of the components' separations provides a useful measure of the beam shape, which is mostly independent of parameters that determine the beam scale and complicate interpretation of simpler profiles. In particular, the method does not depend on the emission altitude and the dipole tilt distribution. The different structures of the radio beam imply manifestly different statistical distributions of R{\_}W, with the conal model being several orders of magnitude less consistent with data than the fan beam model. To bring the conal model into consistency with data, strong effects of observational selection need to be called for, with 80{\%} of Q and M profiles assumed to be undetected because of intrinsic blending effects. It is concluded that the statistical properties of Q and M profiles are more consistent with the fan-shaped beams, than with the traditional nested cone geometry.},

abstract = {High-quality integrated radio profiles of some pulsars contain bifurcated, highly symmetric emission components (BECs). They are observed when our line of sight traverses through a split-fan shaped emission beam. It is shown that for oblique cuts through such a beam, the features appear asymmetric at nearly all frequencies, except for a single 'frequency of symmetry'{\&}nu;sym, at which both peaks in the BEC have the same height. Around {\&}nu;sym, the ratio of flux in the two peaks of a BEC evolves in a way resembling the multifrequency behaviour of J1012+5307. Because of the inherent asymmetry resulting from the oblique traverse of the sightline, each minimum in double notches can be modelled independently. Such a composed model reproduces the double notches of B1929+10 if the fitted function is the microscopic beam of curvature radiation in the orthogonal polarization mode. These results confirm our view that some of the double components in radio pulsar profiles directly reveal the microscopic nature of the emitted radiation beam as the microbeam of the curvature radiation polarized orthogonally to the trajectory of electrons.

abstract = {We analyse the influence of rotation on shapes of pulse profiles of fast-rotating (millisecond) pulsars. Corotation has two opposing effects: 1) the caustic enhancement of the trailing side (TS) by aberration and retardation (AR), which squeezes the emission into a narrower phase interval; 2) the weakening of the TS caused by the asymmetry of curvature radiation about the dipole axis. Analysis of the radii of curvature of electron trajectories in the inertial observer's frame (IOF) enables these two effects to be considered together. We demonstrate that for dipolar magnetic field lines on the TS there exists a `caustic phase' beyond which no emission can be observed. This phase corresponds to the zero (or minimum) curvature of the IOF trajectories and maximum bunching of the emission. The maximum gradient of polarisation angle (PA) in the S-shaped PA curve is also associated with the curvature minimum and occurs at exactly the same phase. The asymmetry of trajectory curvature with respect to the dipole axis affects the curvature emissivity and the efficiency of pair production, suggesting a minimum at the caustic phase. Emission over a fixed range of altitudes, as expected in millisecond pulsars, leads to broad leading profiles and sharp peaks with a cutoff phase on the TS. We apply our results to the main pulse of the 5 ms pulsar J1012+5307.},

abstract = {Using new techniques based on the polarimetric fluctuation spectrum, the fluctuation behaviour of the polarization of individual pulses is examined in three pulsars that show drifting subpulses, allowing various aspects of the fluctuations to be quantified for the first time. Of the three pulsars studied, only PSR B0809+74 shows behaviour completely consistent with the superposition of orthogonal polarization modes (OPMs), and this only at 328 MHz and in superposition with an apparently randomly polarized component. The observed periodic pattern is decomposed into the sum of two orthogonally polarized, out-of-phase drift patterns, one of which shows a dramatic jump in subpulse phase near the leading edge of the pulse window, which probably relates to the phase jump earlier reported in total intensity at 1380 MHz. For PSR B0320+39 and PSR B0818-13, considerable periodic fluctuations away from OPM orientations are seen, a condition that also occurs in the trailing half of the pulse in PSR B0809+74 at 1380 MHz. In some cases the deviation is so strong that the periodic locus of the polarization vector in the Poincar≠≠eacute; sphere is almost circular, in contrast to the strictly colinear states of superposed OPMs. Several possibilities are discussed for the physical origin of these patterns. The similarity between the subpulse patterns in one of the OPMs of PSR B0809+74 at 328 MHz to that of the total intensity signal at 1380 MHz supports a picture of superposed, out of phase drift patterns. To explain the full range of behaviour seen in the three pulsars, it must be possible to produce at least three arbitrarily polarized superposed patterns. While the data do not suggest a particular approach for the empirical decomposition of patterns into non-orthogonally polarized components, the specific, quantitative nature of the results should provide strong constraints for theoretically driven modelling.},

abstract = {Drifting subpulse patterns in pulsar signals are frequently interpreted in terms of a model in which a rotating ring of sparks on the polar cap gives rise to emission from regions of the magnetsophere connected to the sparks by dipolar magnetic field lines. The spacing of drift-bands in time depends on the circulation rate of the polar cap pattern, but to first order the longitudinal phase dependence of the subpulse modulation should obey a frequency-independent relation determined by the geometrical configuration in a similar manner to the polarization position angle. We present here observations at 272-1380 MHz of PSR B0320+39 and PSR B0809+74, both of which show nearly linear drift in two longitude regions, separated by a region of reduced modulation and accompanied by a large step in the phase of the subpulse pattern. We show that the observation of $\backslash$citet{\{}bkk+81{\}} that the subpulse spacing for PSR B0809+74 was 1.8 times greater at 102.5 MHz than at 1720 MHz is most likely an artifact of the phase step, which is only present at high frequencies. The phase steps can be understood as a consequence of observing overlapping offset images of the polar cap spark pattern. We also detected more complicated, frequency-dependent behaviour that would require that the images do not simply differ by rotation about their centers. Detailed modelling of non-axisymmetric refraction or distorted magnetic fields is suggested as a means of pursuing an explanation for this phenomenon.},

abstract = {The basic form of drifting sub-pulses is that of a periodicity whose phase depends (approximately linearly) on both pulse longitude and pulse number. As such, we argue that the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the longitude-time data (called the Two-Dimensional Fluctuation Spectrum; 2DFS) presents an ideal basis for studies of this phenomenon. We examine the 2DFS of a pulsar signal synthesized using the parameters of an empirical model for sub-pulse behaviour. We show that the transform concentrates the modulation power to a relatively small area of phase space in the region corresponding to the characteristic frequency of sub-pulses in longitude and pulse number. This property enables the detection of the presence and parameters of drifting sub-pulses with great sensitivity even in data where the noise level far exceeds the instantaneous flux density of individual pulses. The amplitude of drifting sub-pulses is modulated in time by scintillation and pulse nulling and in longitude by the rotating viewing geometry (with an envelope similar to that of the mean pulse profile). In addition, sub-pulse phase as a function of longitude and pulse number can differ from that of a sinusoid due to variations in the drift rate (often associated with nulling) and through the varying rate of traverse of magnetic azimuth afforded by the sight line. These deviations from uniform sub-pulse drift manifest in the 2DFS as broadening of the otherwise delta-function response of a uniform sinusoid. We show how these phase and amplitude variations can be extracted from the complex spectrum.},

In this paper we describe in detail the timing model used by tempo2, and discuss limitations on the attainable precision. In addition to the intrinsic slow-down behaviour of the pulsar, tempo2 accounts for the effects of a binary orbital motion, the secular motion of the pulsar or binary system, interstellar, Solar system and ionospheric dispersion, observatory motion (including Earth rotation, precession, nutation, polar motion and orbital motion), tropospheric propagation delay, and gravitational time dilation due to binary companions and Solar system bodies. We believe the timing model is accurate in its description of predictable systematic timing effects to better than one nanosecond, except in the case of relativistic binary systems where further theoretical development is needed. The largest remaining sources of potential error are measurement error, interstellar scattering, Solar system ephemeris errors, atomic clock instability and gravitational waves.},

abstract = {We report on an analysis of the polarization of single pulses of PSR B0329+54 at 328 MHz. We find that the distribution of polarization orientations in the central component diverges strongly from the standard picture of orthogonal polarization modes (OPMs), making a remarkable partial annulus on the Poincare sphere. A second, tightly clustered region of density appears in the opposite hemisphere, at a point antipodal to the centre of the annulus. We argue that this can be understood in terms of birefringent alterations in the relative phase of two elliptically polarized propagation modes in the pulsar magnetosphere (i.e. generalised Faraday rotation). The ellipticity of the modes implies a significant charge density in the plasma, while the presence of both senses of circular polarization, and the fact that only one mode shows the effect, supports the view that refracted ordinary-mode rays are involved in the production of the annulus. At other pulse longitudes the polarization (including the circular component) is broadly consistent with an origin in elliptical OPMs, shown here quantitatively for the first time, however considerable non-orthogonal contributions serve to broaden the orientation distribution in an isotropic manner.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT  We present high-quality observations of PSR B0826-34 at 1374 MHz. The emission from this pulsar exhibits strong bursts of pulses followed by long periods of 'null' pulses. When it is strong, the radiation extends throughout the whole pulse period. We show for the first time that there is weak emission during the 'null' phases, which should therefore be considered to be a different mode rather than being null. During this weak mode, the profile is similar to that observed in the strong mode at low radio frequency. Using a phase-tracking method, the pattern of drifting subpulses during the strong mode is seen to be coherent across the whole profile. The drift rate is variable and includes positive and negative values. 13 subpulse bands have been directly observed, covering the whole longitude range. The subpulses and their spacings (P2) are wider in one half of the profile than those in the other half. This difference, and the variation of observed P2 within the two regions, can be accounted for if the magnetic pole is inclined to the rotation axis by about 05. These two regions appear to represent radiation from outer and inner cones. The intensity modulation of subpulses in all longitude ranges is related to the magnitude of the drift rate.},

abstract = {The rotation of more than 700 pulsars has been monitored using the 76-m Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank. Here we report on a new search for glitches in the observations, revealing 128 new glitches in the rotation of 63 pulsars. Combining these new data with those already published, we present a data base containing 315 glitches in 102 pulsars. The data base was used to study the glitch activity among the pulsar population, finding that it peaks for pulsars with a characteristic age {\{}tau{\}}c[{\~{}}] 10 kyr and decreases for longer values of {\{}tau{\}}c, disappearing for objects with {\{}tau{\}}c {\textgreater} 20 Myr. The glitch activity is also smaller in the very young pulsars ({\{}tau{\}}c[lsim] 1 kyr). The cumulative effect of glitches, a collection of instantaneous spin-up events, acts to reduce the regular long-term spin-down rate [IMG]/medium/mnras0414-1679-mu3.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater} of the star. The percentage of [IMG]/medium/mnras0414-1679-mu4.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater} reversed by glitch activity was found to vary between 0.5 and 1.6 per cent for pulsars with spin-down rates [IMG]/medium/mnras0414-1679-mu5.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater} between 10-14 and 3.2 x 10-11 Hz s-1, decreasing to less than 0.01 per cent at both higher and lower spin-down rates. These ratios are interpreted in terms of the amount of superfluid involved in the generation of glitches. In this context, the activity of the youngest pulsar studied, the Crab pulsar, may be explained by quake-like activity within the crust. Pulsars with low spin-down rates seem to exhibit mostly small glitches, matching well the decrease of their crustal superfluid. Through the analysis of glitch sizes, it was found that the particular glitching behaviour of PSR J0537-6910 and the Vela pulsar may be shared by most Vela-like pulsars. These objects present most of their glitches with characteristic frequency and frequency derivative jumps, occurring at regular intervals of time. Their behaviour is different from other glitching pulsars of similar characteristic age.},

abstract = {Recent Arecibo polarimetric observations of the bright five-component pulsar B1737+13 have facilitated a comprehensive new analysis of its pulse-sequence modulation phenomena. The bright leading component in the star's profile, as well as its other conal components, exhibit a roughly periodic, longitude-stationary modulation with an effective P3 of about nine rotation periods. We also find that they show a much slower periodicity at {\~{}}92 rotation periods. Correlation analyses reiterate these regularities and suggest a modulation pattern moving through the profile negatively. These various properties are largely compatible with a rotating subbeam-carousel model having typically 10 `beamlets'. Polar maps are given showing typical subbeam structures that are compatible with the pulsar's somewhat unstable modulation. Geometric analysis finds the central component lagging the centre of the traverse of the polarization position angle, suggesting possible effects of retardation and aberration. There remains little overt evidence for the two modes identified previously. Unlike B1237+25, this pulsar exhibits few if any true nulls, and its core emission is relatively steady.},

abstract = {Stars with initial masses 10 M{\_}{\{}solar{\}} {\textless} M{\_}{\{}initial{\}} {\textless} 100 M{\_}{\{}solar{\}} fuse progressively heavier elements in their centres, up to inert iron. The core then gravitationally collapses to a neutron star or a black hole, leading to an explosion -- an iron-core-collapse supernova (SN). In contrast, extremely massive stars (M{\_}{\{}initial{\}} {\textgreater} 140 M{\_}{\{}solar{\}}), if such exist, have oxygen cores which exceed M{\_}{\{}core{\}} = 50 M{\_}{\{}solar{\}}. There, high temperatures are reached at relatively low densities. Conversion of energetic, pressure-supporting photons into electron-positron pairs occurs prior to oxygen ignition, and leads to a violent contraction that triggers a catastrophic nuclear explosion. Tremendous energies ({\textgreater}{\~{}} 10{\^{}}{\{}52{\}} erg) are released, completely unbinding the star in a pair-instability SN (PISN), with no compact remnant. Transitional objects with 100 M{\_}{\{}solar{\}} {\textless} M{\_}{\{}initial{\}} {\textless} 140 M{\_}{\{}solar{\}}, which end up as iron-core-collapse supernovae following violent mass ejections, perhaps due to short instances of the pair instability, may have been identified. However, genuine PISNe, perhaps common in the early Universe, have not been observed to date. Here, we present our discovery of SN 2007bi, a luminous, slowly evolving supernova located within a dwarf galaxy ({\~{}}1{\%} the size of the Milky Way). We measure the exploding core mass to be likely {\~{}}100 M{\_}{\{}solar{\}}, in which case theory unambiguously predicts a PISN outcome. We show that {\textgreater}3 M{\_}{\{}solar{\}} of radioactive 56Ni were synthesized, and that our observations are well fit by PISN models. A PISN explosion in the local Universe indicates that nearby dwarf galaxies probably host extremely massive stars, above the apparent Galactic limit, perhaps resulting from star formation processes similar to those that created the first stars in the Universe.},

abstract = {We assume that the relativistic sources moving along the dipolar magnetic field lines emit curvature radiation. The beamed emission occurs in the direction of tangents to the field lines, and to receive it, the sight line must align with the tangent within the beaming angle 1/gamma, where gamma is the particle Lorentz factor. By solving the viewing geometry in an inclined and rotating dipole magnetic field, we show that, at any given pulse phase, observer tends to receive radiation only from the specific heights allowed by the geometry. We find outer conal components are emitted at higher altitudes compared to inner components including the core. At any pulse phase, low frequency emission comes from higher altitudes than high frequency emission. We have modeled the emission heights of pulse components of PSR B0329+54, and estimated field line curvature radii and particle Lorentz factors in the emission regions.},

abstract = {We have analyzed high-quality single-pulse data of PSR B0329+54 at 325 and 606 MHz to study the structure of the emission beam. Using the ``window-threshold technique,'' which is suitable for detecting weak emission components, we have detected four additional emission components in the pulse window. Three of these are new components, and the fourth is a confirmation of a recently proposed component. Hence, PSR B0329+54 is now known to have nine emission components-the highest among all known pulsars. The distribution of the pulse components around the central core component indicates that the emission beam consists of four nested cones. The asymmetry in the location of the conal components in the leading versus trailing parts of the profile is interpreted as being due to aberration and retardation in the pulsar magnetosphere. These measurements allow us to determine the precise location of the four conal rings of emission. We find that the successive outer cones are emitted at higher altitudes in the magnetosphere. Furthermore, for any given cone, the emission height at the lower frequency is found to be more than that at the higher frequency. The inferred heights range from {\~{}}160 to {\~{}}1150 km. The set of ``active'' field lines, from which most of the conal radiation appears to originate, is found to be confined to a region located within {\~{}}0.5-{\~{}}0.6 of the polar cap radius. We discuss the implications of our new findings to our understanding of the pulsar emission geometry and its impact on the emission mechanisms.},

abstract = {The classical vacuum gap model of Ruderman {\&} Sutherland, in which spark-associated subbeams of subpulse emission circulate around the magnetic axis due to the EB drift, provides a natural and plausible physical mechanism of the subpulse drift phenomenon. Recent progress in the analysis of drifting subpulses in pulsars has provided a strong support to this model by revealing a number of subbeams circulating around the magnetic axis in a manner compatible with theoretical predictions. However, a more detailed analysis revealed that the circulation speed in a pure vacuum gap is too high when compared with observations. Moreover, some pulsars demonstrate significant time variations of the drift rate, including a change of the apparent drift direction, which is obviously inconsistent with the EB drift scenario in a pure vacuum gap. We resolved these discrepancies by considering a partial flow of iron ions from the positively charged polar cap, coexisting with the production of outflowing electron-positron plasmas. By fitting the observationally deduced drift-rates to the theoretical values, we managed to estimate polar cap surface temperatures in a number of pulsars. The estimated surface temperatures correspond to a small charge depletion of the order of a few percent of the corotational charge density. We also argue that if the thermionic electron outflow from the surface of a negatively charged polar cap is slightly below the Goldreich-Julian density, then the resulting small charge depletion will have similar consequences as in the case of the ions outflow. We thus believe that the sparking discharge of a partially shielded acceleration potential drop occurs in all pulsars, with both positively (``pulsars'') and negatively (``anti-pulsars'') charged polar caps.},

abstract = {We present a model for the main observational characteristics of the radio emission of pulsars with well-organized drifting subpulses. We propose that drifting subpulses result from the modulation of the radio emission mechanism due to long-wavelength drift waves in the magnetosphere. The drift waves are generated at shorter wavelengths, and their non-linear evolution favours accumulation in a specific azimuthal eigenmode with an integral number, m , of nodes encircling the magnetic pole. The electric field of the drift waves is along the magnetic field lines, and this modulates the distribution for particles and hence the radio emission mechanism. The ratio of the frequency of the eigenmode to the rotation frequency of the star is insensitive to the magnetic field strength and the period of rotation, and is of order unity. The period, P 3, of the drifting subpulses is attributed to the mismatch between this frequency and the nearest harmonic of the rotation frequency of the star. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Most studies of the pulsar magnetosphere have assumed a pure magnetic dipole in flat spacetime. However, recent work suggests that the effects of general relativity are in fact of vital importance and that realistic pulsar magnetic fields may have a significant nondipolar component. We introduce a general analytical method for studying the axisymmetric force-free magnetosphere of a slowly-rotating star of arbitrary magnetic field, mass, radius and moment of inertia, including all the effects of general relativity. We confirm that spacelike current is generically present in the polar caps (suggesting a pair production region), irrespective of the stellar magnetic field. We show that general relativity introduces a {\~{}}60{\%} correction to the formula for the dipolar component of the surface magnetic field inferred from spindown. Finally, we show that the location and size of the polar caps can be modified dramatically by even modestly strong higher moments. This can affect emission processes occurring near the star and may explain the decreased beam size of millisecond pulsars.},

abstract = {In the canonical model of a pulsar, rotational energy is transmitted through the surrounding plasma via two electrical circuits, each connecting to the star over a small region known as a "polar cap". For a dipole-magnetized star, the polar caps coincide with the magnetic poles (hence the name), but in general, they can occur any place and take any shape. In light of their crucial importance to most models of pulsar emission (from radio to X-ray to wind), we develop a general technique for determining polar cap properties. We consider a perfectly conducting star surrounded by a force-free magnetosphere and include the effects of general relativity. Using a combined numerical-analytical technique that leverages the rotation rate as a small parameter, we derive a general analytic formula for the polar cap shape and charge-current distribution as a function of the stellar mass, radius, rotation rate, moment of inertia, and magnetic field. We present results for dipole and quadrudipole fields (superposed dipole and quadrupole) inclined relative to the axis of rotation. The inclined dipole polar cap results are the first to include general relativity, and they confirm its essential role in the pulsar problem. The quadrudipole pulsar illustrates the phenomenon of thin annular polar caps. More generally, our method lays a foundation for detailed modeling of pulsar emission with realistic magnetic fields.},

@article{Greif2011,
abstract = {The cosmic dark ages ended a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, when the first stars began to fill the universe with new light. It has generally been argued that these stars formed in isolation and were extremely massive - perhaps 100 times as massive as the Sun. In a recent study, Clark and collaborators showed that this picture requires revision. They demonstrated that the accretion disks that build up around Population III stars are strongly susceptible to fragmentation and that the first stars should therefore form in clusters rather than in isolation. We here use a series of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations performed with the moving mesh code AREPO to follow up on this proposal and to study the influence of environmental parameters on the level of fragmentation. We model the collapse of five independent minihalos from cosmological initial conditions, through the runaway condensation of their central gas clouds, to the formation of the first protostar, and beyond for a further 1000 years. During this latter accretion phase, we represent the optically thick regions of protostars by sink particles. Gas accumulates rapidly in the circumstellar disk around the first protostar, fragmenting vigorously to produce a small group of protostars. After an initial burst, gravitational instability recurs periodically, forming additional protostars with masses ranging from {\~{}} 0.1 to 10 M{\_}sun. Although the shape, multiplicity, and normalization of the protostellar mass function depend on the details of the sink-particle algorithm, fragmentation into protostars with diverse masses occurs in all cases, confirming earlier reports of Population III stars forming in clusters. Depending on the efficiency of later accretion and merging, Population III stars may enter the main sequence in clusters and with much more diverse masses than are commonly assumed.},

abstract = {We have conducted a detailed analysis of the emission geometry of a  handful of radio pulsars that have prominent, multiple-component  profiles at meter wavelengths. From careful determination of the total  number of emission components and their locations in pulse longitude, we  find that all of the six pulsars show clear evidence for retardation and  aberration effects in the conal emission beams. Using this information,  coupled with a dipolar field geometry, we obtain estimates of the height  and transverse location in the magnetosphere for each of the emitting  cones in these pulsars. These results support our earlier conclusions  for PSR B0329+54 in that we find successive outer cones (in cases of  multiple-cone pulsars) being emitted at higher altitudes in the  magnetosphere. The range of inferred heights is from {\~{}}200 to 2200 km.  The set of ``active'' field lines from which the conal emissions  originate are located in the region from {\~{}}0.22 to {\~{}}0.74 times the polar  cap radius. At the neutron star surface, these conal rings map to radii  of a few to several tens of meters, and the separation between  successive rings is about 10-20 m. We discuss the implications of these  findings for the understanding of the pulsar emission geometry and for  current theories and models of the emission mechanism.},

abstract = {Pulsars with drifting subpulses are thought to be an important key to unlocking the mystery of how radio pulsars work. We present new results from high sensitivity GMRT observations of PSR B0826-34 - a wide profile pulsar that exhibits an interesting but complicated drifting pattern. We provide a model to explain the observed subpulse drift properties of this pulsar, including the apparent reversals of the drift direction. In this model, PSR B0826-34 is close to being an aligned rotator. Using information about the polarization and frequency evolution of the pulse profile, we solve for the emission geometry of this pulsar and show that the angle between the rotation axis and the dipole magnetic axis is less than 5 ≠≠deg;. As a result, our line of sight samples a circular path that is entirely within the emission beam. We see evidence for as many as 6 to 7 drifting bands in the main pulse at 318 MHz, which are all part of a circulating system of about 15 spark-associated subpulse emission beams that form, upon averaging, one conal ring of the mean emission. We also see evidence for a second ring of emission, which becomes dominant at higher frequencies (above 1 GHz) due to the nature of the emission geometry. We model the subpulse drift behaviour of this pulsar in detail, providing quantitative treatments of the aliasing problem and various effects of geometry which play an important role. The observed drift rate is an aliased version of the true drift rate which is such that a subpulse drifts to the location of the adjacent subpulse (or a multiple thereof) in about one pulsar period. We show that small variations, of the order of 3-8{\%}, in the mean drift rate are then enough to explain the apparent reversals of drift direction seen in the data. We find the mean circulation time of the drift pattern to be significantly longer than the predictions of the original $\backslash$citet{\{}RS75{\}} model and propose an explanation for this, which relates to modified models with temperature regulated partial ion flow in the polar vacuum gap. The small variations in drift rate are then explained by very small heating and cooling effects - less than 3500 K change in the ≠≠sim;2.5 ≠≠times; 106 K surface temperature of the neutron star polar cap. From a detailed consideration of the variation of the mean subpulse separation across the main pulse window, we show that the circulating spark pattern is not centred around the dipole axis, but around a point much closer (within a degree or so) to the rotation axis. This is an indicator of the presence of a ``local pole'' corresponding to the non-dipolar magnetic fields that are expected to be present close to the neutron star surface. PSR B0826-34 thus provides a very rich and powerful system in which to explore important aspects of the physics of pulsar radio emission and neutron star magnetospheres.},

abstract = {The Crab pulsar was discovered by the occasional exceptionally bright radio pulses it emits, subsequently dubbed 'giant' pulses. Only two other pulsars are known to emit giant pulses. There is no satisfactory explanation for the occurrence of giant pulses, nor is there a complete theory of the pulsar emission mechanism in general. Competing models for the radio emission mechanism can be distinguished by the temporal structure of their coherent emission. Here we report the discovery of isolated, highly polarized, two-nanosecond subpulses within the giant radio pulses from the Crab pulsar. The plasma structures responsible for these emissions must be smaller than one metre in size, making them by far the smallest objects ever detected and resolved outside the Solar System, and the brightest transient radio sources in the sky. Only one of the current models--the collapse of plasma-turbulent wave packets in the pulsar magnetosphere--can account for the nanopulses we observe.},

abstract = {Some radio pulsars show clear "drifting subpulses", in which subpulses are seen to drift in pulse longitude in a systematic pattern. Here we examine how the drifting subpulses of PSR B0809+74 evolve with time and observing frequency. We show that the subpulse period (P3) is constant on timescales of days, months and years, and between 14-5100 MHz. Despite this, the shapes of the driftbands change radically with frequency. Previous studies have concluded that, while the subpulses appear to move through the pulse window approximately linearly at low frequencies ({\textless}500 MHz), a discrete step of {\~{}}180° in subpulse phase is observed at higher frequencies ({\textgreater}820 MHz) near to the peak of the average pulse profile. We use LOFAR, GMRT, GBT, WSRT and Effelsberg 100-m data to explore the frequency-dependence of this phase step. We show that the size of the subpulse phase step increases gradually, and is observable even at low frequencies. We attribute the subpulse phase step to the presence of two separate driftbands, whose relative arrival times vary with frequency - one driftband arriving 30 pulses earlier at 20 MHz than it does at 1380 MHz, whilst the other arrives simultaneously at all frequencies. The drifting pattern which is observed here cannot be explained by either the rotating carousel model or the surface oscillation model, and could provide new insight into the physical processes happening within the pulsar magnetosphere.},

We discuss how metallicity, and a simplified prescription for its effect on mass loss, affects the evolution and final fate of massive stars. We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity. Provided single stars rotate rapidly enough at death, we speculate upon stellar populations that might produce gamma-ray bursts and jet-driven supernovae.},

We perform photometry and simple spectral fitting for our detected sources, and construct luminosity functions, X-ray color-magnitude and color-color diagrams. Eighty-seven X-ray sources show variability on timescales from hours to years. Thirty-one of the new X-ray sources are identified with chromospherically active binaries from the catalogs of Albrow et al. The radial distributions of detected sources imply roughly 70 are background sources of some kind. Most source spectra are well-fit by thermal plasma models, except for quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries (qLMXBs, containing accreting neutron stars) and millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We identify three new candidate qLMXBs with relatively low X-ray luminosities. One of the brightest cataclysmic variables (CVs, X10) shows evidence (a 4.7 hour period pulsation and strong soft X-ray emission) for a magnetically dominated accretion flow as in AM Her systems. Most of the bright CVs require intrinsic N{\_}H columns of order 10{\^{}}{\{}21{\}} cm{\^{}}-2, suggesting a possible DQ Her nature. A group of X-ray sources associated with bright (sub)giant stars also requires intrinsic absorption. By comparing the X-ray colors, luminosities, variability, and quality of spectral fits of the detected MSPs to those of unidentified sources, we estimate that a total of $\backslash${\~{}}25-30 MSPs exist in 47 Tuc ({\textless}60 at 95{\%} confidence), regardless of their radio beaming fraction. We estimate that the total number of neutron stars in 47 Tuc is of order 300, reducing the discrepancy between theoretical neutron star retention rates and observed neutron star populations in globular clusters.

Through simultaneous observations, we detected synchronous switching in the radio and x-ray emission properties of PSR B0943+10. When the pulsar is in a sustained radio-"bright" mode, the x-rays show only an unpulsed, nonthermal component. Conversely, when the pulsar is in a radio-"quiet" mode, the x-ray luminosity more than doubles and a 100{\%} pulsed thermal component is observed along with the nonthermal component. This indicates rapid, global changes to the conditions in the magnetosphere, which challenge all proposed pulsar emission theories.},

Considering millisecond pulsars as the unique potential source of gamma-rays in the globular cluster, constraints based on emission models are derived: on the magnetic field in the average pulsar nebula and on the conversion efficiency of spin-down power to gamma-ray photons or to relativistic leptons.},

abstract = {Contemporary pulsar-timing experiments have reached a sensitivity level where systematic errors introduced by existing analysis procedures are limiting the achievable science. We have developed TEMPO2, a new pulsar-timing package that contains propagation and other relevant effects implemented at the 1-ns level of precision (a factor of {\~{}}100 more precise than previously obtainable). In contrast with earlier timing packages, TEMPO2 is compliant with the general relativistic framework of the IAU 1991 and 2000 resolutions and hence uses the International Celestial Reference System, Barycentric Coordinate Time and up-to-date precession, nutation and polar motion models. TEMPO2 provides a generic and extensible set of tools to aid in the analysis and visualization of pulsar-timing data. We provide an overview of the timing model, its accuracy and differences relative to earlier work. We also present a new scheme for predictive use of the timing model that removes existing processing artefacts by properly modelling the frequency dependence of pulse phase.},

abstract = {The Parkes multibeam pulsar survey has led to the discovery of more than 700 pulsars. In this paper, we provide timing solutions, flux densities and pulse profiles for 180 of these new discoveries. Two pulsars, PSRs J1736-2843 and J1847-0130, have rotational periods P {\textgreater} 6s and are therefore among the slowest rotating radio pulsars known. Conversely, with P= 1.8ms, PSR J1843-1113 has the third-shortest period of pulsars currently known. This pulsar and PSR J1905+0400 (P= 3.8ms) are both solitary. We also provide orbital parameters for a new binary system, PSR J1420-5625, which has P= 34ms, an orbital period of 40d and a minimum companion mass of 0.4 solar masses. The 10°-wide strip along the Galactic plane that was surveyed is known to contain 264 radio pulsars that were discovered prior to the multibeam pulsar survey. We have redetected almost all of these pulsars and provide new dispersion measure values and flux densities at 20cm for the redetected pulsars.},

   abstract = {The electric field outside a steadily rotating, uniformly magnetized sphere is determined for the general case in which the magnetic and rotational axes, though both passing through the center of the sphere, may be oriented at any angle relative to each other. The sphere is perfectly conducting and is surrounded by a conducting plasma of charged particles constrained to move along the magnetic field lines. The electric field generated by the rotating sphere is found to be exactly that required to cause the surrounding plasma to rotate with the sphere. When the magnetic and rotational axes are parallel or antiparallel, co-rotation of sphere and plasma is caused by the E?B drift. For all other orientations Fermi acceleration plays a role in causing co-rotation. The electric field in a reference frame rotating with the sphere is identically zero for the symmetric (dipole) magnetic field under consideration. Therefore, charged particles in the plasma do not change energy in this frame, although they appear alternately to gain and lose small amounts of energy in a nonrotating frame. It is concluded, however, that the electric field generated by the earth's ?wobbling? magnetic axis in the real magnetosphere, distorted by the solar wind, probably does cause charged particles to experience net energy changes over a number of revolutions around the earth. It thus provides a mechanism for diffusion of plasma and of higher-energy particles through the magnetosphere. Calculations of such effects must take into account the high conductivity of the plasma in the magnetosphere if they are to give correct results.},

abstract = {A new set of software applications and libraries for use in the archival and analysis of pulsar astronomical data is introduced. Known collectively as the PSRCHIVE scheme, the code was developed in parallel with a new data storage format called PSRFITS, which is based on the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS). Both of these projects utilise a modular, object-oriented design philosophy. PSRCHIVE is an open source development environment that incorporates an extensive range of C++ object classes and pre-built command line and graphical utilities. These deal transparently and simultaneously with multiple data storage formats, thereby enhancing data portability and facilitating the adoption of the PSRFITS file format. Here, data are stored in a series of modular header-data units that provide flexibility and scope for future expansion. As it is based on FITS, various standard libraries and applications may be used for data input/output and visualisation. Both PSRCHIVE and PSRFITS are made publicly available to the academic community in the hope that this will promote their widespread use and acceptance.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The aim of this work is to explore the connection between variability in single pulse intensity and periodic switching of the position angle (PA) of the linear polarisation and how this relates to the radio emission mechanism. There are five pulsars reported in the literature for which the PA is seen to periodically change in tandem with the variability in their pulse shapes. This behaviour is seemingly incompatible with two well established models of the radio emission mechanism. The purpose of this study is to investigate in a systematic way whether this phenomenon is common or if only happens in special cases, using a high-quality sample of pulsar data observed with the Parkes telescope. We show that the connection between polarisation variability and intensity variability is more common than previously expected.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We argue that these HMP stars are the second generation stars being formed from gases which were chemically enriched by the first generation supernovae. The key to this solution is the very unusual abundance patterns of these HMP stars with important similarities and differences. We can reproduce these abundance features with the core-collapse ``faint'' supernova models which undergo extensive matter mixing and fallback during the explosion.},

abstract = {Individual giant radio pulses (GRPs) from the Crab pulsar last only a few microseconds. However, during that time they rank among the brightest objects in the radio sky reaching peak flux densities of up to 1500 Jy even at high radio frequencies. Our observations show that GRPs can be found in all phases of ordinary radio emission including the two high frequency components (HFCs) visible only between 5 and 9 GHz [Moffett, D.A., Hankins, T.H. Multifrequency radio observations of the Crab pulsar. Astrophys. J. 468, 779-783, 1996]. This leads us to believe that there is no difference in the emission mechanism of the main pulse (MP), inter pulse (IP) and HFCs. High resolution dynamic spectra from our recent observations of giant pulses with the Effelsberg telescope at a center frequency of 8.35 GHz show distinct spectral maxima within our observational bandwidth of 500 MHz for individual pulses. Their narrow band components appear to be brighter at higher frequencies (8.6 GHz) than at lower ones (8.1 GHz). Moreover, there is an evidence for spectral evolution within and between those structures. High frequency features occur earlier than low frequency ones. Strong plasma turbulence might be a feasible mechanism for the creation of the high energy densities of ???6.7 ?? 104 erg cm-3 and brightness temperatures of ???1031 K. ?? 2005 COSPAR.

abstract = {The inclusion of rotationally-induced mixing in stellar evolution can alter the structure and composition of presupernova stars. We survey the effects of progenitor rotation on nucleosynthetic yields in Population III and II supernovae using the new adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code CASTRO. We examine spherical explosions in 15, 25 and 40 solar mass stars at Z = 0 and 10{\^{}}-4 solar metallicity with three explosion energies and two rotation rates. Rotation in the Z = 0 models resulted in primary nitrogen production and a stronger hydrogen burning shell which led all models to die as red supergiants. On the other hand, the Z=10{\^{}}-4 solar metallicity models that included rotation ended their lives as compact blue stars. Because of their extended structure, the hydrodynamics favors more mixing and less fallback in the metal free stars than the Z = 10{\^{}}-4 models. As expected, higher energy explosions produce more enrichment and less fallback than do lower energy explosions, and less massive stars produce more enrichment and leave behind smaller remnants than do more massive stars. We compare our nucleosynthetic yields to the chemical abundances in the three most iron-poor stars yet found and reproduce the abundance pattern of one, HE 0557-4840, with a zero metallicity 15 solar mass, 2.4 x 10{\^{}}51 erg supernova. A Salpeter IMF averaged integration of our yields for Z=0 models with explosion energies of 2.4x10{\^{}}51 ergs or less is in good agreement with the abundances observed in larger samples of extremely metal-poor stars, provided 15 solar mass stars are included. Since the abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars likely arise from a representative sample of progenitors, our yields suggest that low-mass supernovae contributed the bulk of the metals to the early universe.},

abstract = {We report on multi-epoch, multifrequency observations of 64 pulsars with high spectral and time resolution. Scintillation parameters were obtained for 49 pulsars, including 13 millisecond pulsars. Scintillation speeds were derived for all 49, which doubles the number of pulsars with speeds measured in this way. There is excellent agreement between the scintillation speed and proper motion for the millisecond pulsars in our sample using the simple assumption of a mid-placed scattering screen. This indicates that the scaleheight of scattering electrons is similar to that of the dispersing electrons. In addition, we present observations of the Vela pulsar at 14 and 23 GHz, and show that the scintillation bandwidth scales as nu{\^{}}3.93 over a factor of 100 in observing frequency. We show that for PSR J0742-2822, and perhaps PSR J0837-4135, the Gum nebula is responsible for the high level of turbulence along their lines of sight, contrary to previous indications. There is a significant correlation between the scintillation speeds and the product of the pulsar's period and period derivative for the `normal' pulsars. However, we believe this to be caused by selection effects both in pulsar detection experiments and in the choice of pulsars used in scintillation studies.},

abstract = {The correlation of subpulse phases across nulls is investigated in the radio pulsar PSR B0031-07, using 29849 periods of high-quality data obtained with the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT) which operates at 327MHz. Assuming that the turn-off and turn-on subpulse phases (the phase of the subpulse in the last period before the null and that in the first period after the null, respectively) are independent random variables, the expected distribution of their difference (i.e. the total drift) is inconsistent with the observed distribution for null transitions within the same drift mode; this implies a correlation of subpulse phase across nulls. However, this correlation decreases with null duration for both the dominant drift modes. Substantial drifting occurs during short nulls (one to four periods); the drift rate during the short nulls appears to be constant for a class A transition, whereas it decreases with null duration for class B transitions. These results, together with the reported behaviour of PSR B1944+17 and PSR B0809+74, seem to imply different time-scales for phase correlation in different pulsars.},

abstract = {Some radio pulsars show clear "drifting subpulses", in which subpulses are seen to drift in pulse longitude in a systematic pattern. Here we examine how the drifting subpulses of PSR B0809+74 evolve with time and observing frequency. We show that the subpulse period (P3) is constant on timescales of days, months and years, and between 14-5100 MHz. Despite this, the shapes of the driftbands change radically with frequency. Previous studies have concluded that, while the subpulses appear to move through the pulse window approximately linearly at low frequencies ({\textless}500 MHz), a discrete step of {\~{}}180° in subpulse phase is observed at higher frequencies ({\textgreater}820 MHz) near to the peak of the average pulse profile. We use LOFAR, GMRT, GBT, WSRT and Effelsberg 100-m data to explore the frequency-dependence of this phase step. We show that the size of the subpulse phase step increases gradually, and is observable even at low frequencies. We attribute the subpulse phase step to the presence of two separate driftbands, whose relative arrival times vary with frequency - one driftband arriving 30 pulses earlier at 20 MHz than it does at 1380 MHz, whilst the other arrives simultaneously at all frequencies. The drifting pattern which is observed here cannot be explained by either the rotating carousel model or the surface oscillation model, and could provide new insight into the physical processes happening within the pulsar magnetosphere.},

abstract = {We use the low frequency (110-180 MHz) capabilities of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) to characterise a large collection of single pulses from three low magnetic field pulsars. Using the Pulsar Machine II (PuMa-II) to acquire and coherently dedisperse the pulsar signals, we examine whether the bright pulses observed in these pulsars are related to the classical giant pulse emission. Giant pulses are reported from PSR B1112+50 and bright pulses from the PSRs B1133+16 and B0031-07. These pulsars also exhibit large intensity modulations observed as rapid changes in the single pulse intensity. Evidence of global magnetospheric effects is provided by our detection of bright double pulses in PSRs B0031-07 and B1133+16. Using the multi-frequency observations, we accurately determine the dispersion measures (4.844 ± 0.002 for B1133+16 and 9.1750 ± 0.0001 for B1112+50), derive the radio emission height in PSR B1133+16 and report on the properties of subpulse drift modes in these pulsars. We also find that these pulsars show a much larger intensity modulation at low sky frequencies resulting in narrow and bright emissions.},

abstract = {The element abundance ratios of four low-mass stars with extremely low metallicities indicate that the gas out of which the stars formed was enriched in each case by at most a few, and potentially only one low-energy, supernova. Such supernovae yield large quantities of light elements such as carbon but very little iron. The dominance of low-energy supernovae is surprising, because it has been expected that the first stars were extremely massive, and that they disintegrated in pair-instability explosions that would rapidly enrich galaxies in iron. What has remained unclear is the yield of iron from the first supernovae, because hitherto no star is unambiguously interpreted as encapsulating the yield of a single supernova. Here we report the optical spectrum of SMSS J031300.36- 670839.3, which shows no evidence of iron (with an upper limit of 10{\^{}}-7.1 times solar abundance). Based on a comparison of its abundance pattern with those of models, we conclude that the star was seeded with material from a single supernova with an original mass of {\~{}}60 Mo (and that the supernova left behind a black hole). Taken together with the previously mentioned low-metallicity stars, we conclude that low-energy supernovae were common in the early Universe, and that such supernovae yield light element enrichment with insignificant iron. Reduced stellar feedback both chemically and mechanically from low-energy supernovae would have enabled first-generation stars to form over an extended period. We speculate that such stars may perhaps have had an important role in the epoch of cosmic reionization and the chemical evolution of early galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a single pulse study of pulsar B1944+17, whose non-random nulls dominate nearly 70{\%} of its pulses and usually occur at mode boundaries. When not in the null state, this pulsar displays four bright modes of emission, three of which exhibit drifting subpulses. B1944+17 displays a weak interpulse whose position relative to the main pulse we find to be frequency independent. Its emission is nearly 100{\%} polarized, its polarization-angle traverse is very shallow and opposite in direction to that of the main pulse, and it nulls approximately two-thirds of the time. Geometric modeling indicates that this pulsar is a nearly aligned rotator whose alpha value is hardly 2 degrees--i.e., its magnetic axis is so closely aligned with its rotation axis that its sightline orbit remains within its conal beam. The star's nulls appear to be of two distinct types: those with lengths less than about 8 rotation periods appear to be pseudonulls--that is, produced by "empty" sightline traverses through the conal beam system; whereas the longer nulls appear to represent actual cessations of the pulsar's emission engine.},

abstract = {Abstract The extreme physical conditions in millisecond pulsar magnetospheres, as well as an evolutionary history that differs from that of normal pulsars, raise the question whether these objects also differ in their radio emission properties. We have monitored a large sample of millisecond pulsars for a period of 3 yr using the 100 m Effelsberg radio telescope in order to compare the radio emission properties of these two pulsar populations. Our sample comprises a homogeneous data set of very high quality. With some notable exceptions, our findings suggest that the two groups of objects share many common properties. A comparison of the spectral indices between samples of normal and millisecond pulsars demonstrates that millisecond pulsar spectra are not significantly different from those of normal pulsars. This is contrary to what has previously been thought. There is evidence, however, that millisecond pulsars are slightly less luminous and less efficient radio emitters than normal pulsars. We confirm recent suggestions that a diversity exists among the luminosities of millisecond pulsars, with the isolated millisecond pulsars being less luminous than the binary millisecond pulsars, implying that the different evolutionary history has an influence on the emission properties. There are indications that old millisecond pulsars exhibit somewhat flatter spectra than the presumably younger ones. We present evidence that, contrary to common belief, the millisecond pulsar profiles are only marginally more complex than those found among the normal pulsar population. Moreover, the development of the profiles with frequency is rather slow, suggesting very compact magnetospheres. The profile development seems to anticorrelate with the companion mass and the spin period, again suggesting that the amount of mass transfer in a binary system might directly influence the emission properties. The angular radius of radio beams of millisecond pulsars does not follow the scaling predicted from a canonical pulsar model applicable for normal pulsars. Instead, they are systematically smaller, supporting the concept of a critical rotational period below which such a scaling ceases to exist. The smaller inferred luminosity and narrower emission beams will need to be considered in future calculations of the birthrate of the Galactic population.},

abstract = {We have developed a relativistic model for pulsar radio emission and polarization by taking into account a detailed geometry of emission region, rotation, and modulation. The sparks activity on the polar cap leads to plasma columns in the emission region and modulated emission. By considering relativistic plasma bunches streaming out along the rotating dipolar field lines as a source of curvature radiation, we have deduced the polarization state of the radiation field in terms of the Stokes parameters. We have simulated a set of typical pulse profiles and analyzed the role of viewing geometry, rotation, and modulation in the pulsar polarization profiles. Our simulations explain most of the diverse behaviors of polarization generally found in pulsar radio profiles. We show that both the "antisymmetric" and "symmetric" types of circular polarization are possible within the framework of curvature radiation. We also show that the "kinky" nature in the polarization position angle traverses might be due to the rotation and modulation effects. The phase lag of the polarization position angle inflection point relative to the phase of core peak depends upon the rotationally induced asymmetry in the curvature of source trajectory and modulation.},

abstract = {We report on observations of the recently detected (Kuzmin et al. $\backslash$cite{\{}kuzmin04{\}}) giant pulses (GPs) from the pulsar PSR B0031-07 at 40 and 111 MHz. At 40 MHz the peak flux density of the strongest pulse is 1100 Jy, which is 400 times as high as the peak flux density of the average pulse (AP). A pulse whose observed peak flux exceeded the peak of the AP by more than a factor of 200 is encountered approximately once in 800 observed periods. Peak flux density of the GPs compared to the AP peak flux density SGPpeak/SAPpeak has roughly a power-law distribution with a slope of -4.5. GPs at 40 MHz are essentially stronger than those ones at 111 MHz. This excess is approximately in inverse proportion to the frequency ratio. The giant pulses are much narrower than the AP, and cluster in two narrow regions of the AP near the peaks of the two components of the AP. Some of the GPs emit at both phases and are double. The separation of the double GP emission regions depends on frequency. Similarly to the frequency dependence of the width of the AP, it is less at 111 MHz than at 40 MHz. This suggests that GPs are emitted from the same region of the magnetosphere as the AP, that is in a hollow cone over the polar cap instead of the light cylinder region. PSR B0031-07 as well as the previously detected PSR B1112+50 are the first pulsars with GPs that do not have a high magnetic field at the light cylinder. One may suggest that there are two classes of GPs, one associated with high-energy emission from outer gaps, the other associated with polar radio emission. The GPs of PSR B0031-07 and PSR B1112+50 are of the second class. The dispersion measure DM is found to be 10.900 ± 0.003 pc cm-3.},

abstract = {The on-going PALFA survey at the Arecibo Observatory began in 2004 and is searching for radio pulsars in the Galactic plane at 1.4 GHz. Observations since 2009 have been made with new wider-bandwidth spectrometers than were previously employed in this survey. A new data reduction pipeline has been in place since mid-2011 which consists of standard methods using dedispersion, searches for accelerated periodic sources, and search for single pulses, as well as new interference-excision strategies and candidate selection heuristics. This pipeline has been used to discover 41 pulsars, including 8 millisecond pulsars (MSPs; P {\textless} 10 ms), bringing the PALFA survey's discovery totals to 145 pulsars, including 17 MSPs, and one Fast Radio Burst (FRB). The pipeline presented here has also re-detected 188 previously known pulsars including 60 found in PALFA data by re-analyzing observations previously searched by other pipelines. A comprehensive description of the survey sensitivity, including the effect of interference and red noise, has been determined using synthetic pulsar signals with various parameters and amplitudes injected into real survey observations and subsequently recovered with the data reduction pipeline. We have confirmed that the PALFA survey achieves the sensitivity to MSPs predicted by theoretical models. However, we also find that compared to theoretical survey sensitivity models commonly used there is a degradation in sensitivity to pulsars with periods P {\textgreater}= 100 ms that gradually becomes up to a factor of {\~{}}10 worse for P {\textgreater} 4 s at DM {\textless} 150 pc/cc. This degradation of sensitivity at long periods is largely due to red noise. We find that 35 +- 3{\%} of pulsars are missed despite being bright enough to be detected in the absence of red noise. This reduced sensitivity could have implications on estimates of the number of long-period pulsars in the Galaxy.},

abstract = {The double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039A/B offers exceptional possibilities for detailed probes of the structure of the pulsar magnetosphere, pulsar winds and relativistic reconnection. We numerically model the distortions of the magnetosphere of pulsar B by the magnetized wind from pulsar A, including effects of magnetic reconnection and of the geodetic precession. Geodetic precession leads to secular evolution of the geometric parameters and effectively allows a 3D view of the magnetosphere. Using the two complimentary models of pulsar B's magnetosphere, adapted from the Earth's magnetosphere models by Tsyganenko (ideal pressure confinement) and Dungey (highly resistive limit), we determine the precise location and shape of the coherent radio emission generation region within pulsar B's magnetosphere. We successfully reproduce orbital variations and secular evolution of the profile of B, as well as subpulse drift (due to reconnection between the magnetospheric and wind magnetic fields), and determine the location and the shape of the emission region. The emission region is located at about 3750 stellar radii and has a horseshoe-like shape, which is centered on the polar magnetic field lines. The best fit angular parameters of the emission region indicate that radio emission is generated on the field lines which, according to the theoretical models, originate close to the poles and carry the maximum current. When considered together, the results of the two models converge and can explain why the modulation of B's radio emission at A's period is observed only within a certain orbital phase region. Our results imply that the wind of pulsar A has a striped structure only 1000 light cylinder radii away. We discuss the implications of these results for pulsar magnetospheric models, mechanisms of coherent radio emission generation, and reconnection rates in relativistic plasma.},

Our knowledge of these exciting objects has greatly increased in recent years, mainly due to successful surveys which have brought the known pulsar population to over 1700. There are now 80 binary and millisecond pulsars associated with the disk of our Galaxy, and a further 103 pulsars in 24 of the Galactic globular clusters. Recent highlights have been the discovery of the first ever double pulsar system and a recent flurry of discoveries in globular clusters, in particular Terzan 5.},

abstract = {With the largest dish Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), both the mean and single pulses of PSR B2016{\$}+{\$}28, especially including the single-pulse structure, are investigated in detail in this study. The mean pulse profiles at different frequencies can be well fitted in a conal model, and the peak separation of intensity-dependent pulse profiles increases with intensity. The integrated pulses are obviously frequency dependent (pulse width decreases by {\$}\backslashsim\backslash,20\backslash{\%}{\$} as frequency increases from 300 MHz to 750 MHz), but the structure of single pulses changes slightly (the corresponding correlation scale decreases by only {\$}\backslashsim\backslash,1\backslash{\%}{\$}). This disparity between mean and single pulses provides independent evidence for the existence of the RS-type vacuum inner gap, indicating a strong bond between particles on the pulsar surface. Diffused drifting sub-pulses are analyzed. The results show that the modulation period along pulse series ({\$}P{\_}3{\$}) is positively correlated to the separation between two adjacent sub-pulses ({\$}P{\_}2{\$}). This correlation may hint a rough surface on the pulsar, eventually resulting in the irregular drift of sparks. All the observational results may have significant implications in the dynamics of pulsar magnetosphere and are discussed extensively in this paper.},

abstract = {The viability of polar cap models for high-energy emission from millisecond pulsars is discussed. It is shown that in millisecond pulsars, polar gap acceleration along the last open field lines is radiation-reaction limited, that is, the maximum energy to which particles can be accelerated is determined by balancing the energy-loss rate (due to curvature radiation) with the gap-acceleration rate. The maximum Lorentz factor is limited by curvature radiation and is not sensitive to the specific acceleration model. However, the distance (from the polar cap) at which the Lorentz factor achieves the limit is model dependent, and can be between one-hundredth (for the vacuum gap) and above one-tenth (for the space-charge limited gap) of a stellar radius distant from the polar cap for a pulsar period {\$}P = 2 ms{\$} and a surface magnetic field {\$}B{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}} = 7.5 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}4{\$} T. Because of the radiation reaction constraint and the relatively weak magnetic field, both the expected multiplicity (number of pairs per primary particle) and the Lorentz factor of the outflowing one-dimensional magnetospheric e{\$}{\^{}}\backslashpm{\$} plasma from the polar gap are considerably lower than those for normal pulsars. Assuming space-charge limited flow, the location of the pair production front (PPF) is estimated to occur at about one stellar radius above the polar cap, which is significantly higher than that for normal pulsars. If the observed X-ray emission originates in the region near or above the PPF, the wide hollow-cone can reproduce the observed wide double-peaked feature of the light curves without using the aligned rotator assumption.},

abstract = {An investigation of nulling and subpulse drifting in the two pulsars PSRs 0809+74 and 0818-13 is presented from data recorded at 408 MHz. Upper limits are placed, in the case of PSR 0809+74, on the time constants of the decay and rise of pulse energy at nulls of 0.065 and 0.26 s respectively. Significant drifting is found to occur during nulls in this pulsar. Its behavior is best described by a sudden change of drift rate at the start of the null, followed by an exponential relaxation to the normal drift rate, with emission restarting when a fixed fraction of the recovery has taken place. A similar phenomenon is observed for PSR 0818-13. For both pulsars the magnitude of these events appears to be proportional to the null strength. These observations are taken as evidence that the entity that is drifting survives in some form during nulls. An attempt is made to interpret this in terms of current models.},

abstract = {We report discovery of several energetic radio bursts at 34 MHz, using the Gauribidanur radio telescope. The radio bursts exhibit two important properties associated with the propagation of astronomical signals through the interstellar medium: (i) frequency dependent dispersive delays across the observing bandwidth, and (ii) Faraday rotation of the plane of linear polarization. These bursts sample a range of dispersion measures (DM; 1.4--3.6{\$}{\~{}}{\{}\backslashrm pc{\}}{\~{}}{\{}\backslashrm cm{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}), and show DM-variation at timescales of the order of a minute. Using groups of bursts having a consistent DM, we show that the bursts have originated from the radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar Geminga. Detection of these bursts supports the existence of occasional radio emission from Geminga. The rare occurrence of these bursts, and the short timescale variation in their DM (if really caused by the intervening medium or the pulsar magnetosphere), might provide clues as to why the pulsar has not been detected in earlier sensitive searches. We present details of the observations and search procedure used to discover these bursts, a detailed analysis of their properties, and evidences of these bursts being associated with Geminga pulsar, and discuss briefly the possible emission mechanism of these bursts.},

abstract = {Subpulse modulation has been regarded as one of the most insightful and intriguing aspects of pulsar radio emission. This phenomenon is generally explained by the presence of a carousel of sparks in the polar acceleration gap region that rotates around the magnetic axis due to the E{\$}\backslashtimes{\$}B drift. While there have been extensive single pulse studies, geometric signatures of the underlying carousel, or lack thereof, in simultaneous multi-frequency observations have remained largely unexplored. This work presents a theoretical account of such expected signatures, particularly that of a geometry induced phase-offset in subpulse modulation, including various formulae that can be readily applied to observations. A notable result is a method to resolve aliasing in the measured subpulse modulation period without relying on knowledge of the viewing geometry parameters. It is also shown in detail that the geometry induced phase-offset enables critical tests of various observed phenomena as well as proposed hypotheses, e.g., multi-altitude emission, magnetic field twisting, pseudo-nulls, etc., in addition to that of the carousel model itself. Finally, a detailed analysis of a 327 MHz pulse-sequence of PSR B1237+25 is presented as a case study to test the single-frequency multi-altitude emission scenario. The analysis provides a firm evidence of inner and outer conal components of this pulsar to have originated from the same carousel of subbeams and emitted at different heights.},

abstract = {The origin of two distinct pairs of conal emission components in pulsars, associated with the "outer" and the "inner" emission cones, as well as the marked difference in their observed spectral properties, is poorly understood. The sub-pulse modulation in the corresponding conal components, if mapped back to the underlying system of sub-beams rotating around the magnetic axis in the polar cap, as envisioned by Ruderman {\&} Sutherland, provides a potential way to investigate the emission morphologies in the two conal regions, and more importantly, any inter-relationship between them. The bright pulsar B1237+25 with its special viewing geometry where the sightline traverses almost through the magnetic axis, along with a rich variety in pulse-to-pulse fluctuations, provides an excellent but challenging opportunity to map the underlying emission patterns across the full transverse slice of its polar emission region. We present here our analysis on a number of pulse sequences from this star to map and study any relationship between the underlying patterns responsible for emission in the two pairs of presumed conal components and a core component of this pulsar. The results from our correlation analysis of the two conal emission patterns strongly support the view that the two cones of this pulsar (the outer and the inner cone) originate from a common system of sub-beams. We also see evidence for a twist in the emission columns, most likely associated with a corresponding twist in the magnetic field structure. We discuss these results, and their implications, including a possibility that the core component of this pulsar shares its origin partly with the conal counterparts.},

abstract = {We report the design and development of a self-contained multi-band receiver (MBR) system, intended for use with a single large aperture to facilitate sensitive and high time-resolution observations simultaneously in 10 discrete frequency bands sampling a wide spectral span (100-1500 MHz) in a nearly log-periodic fashion. The development of this system was primarily motivated by need for tomographic studies of pulsar polar emission regions. Although the system design is optimized for the primary goal, it is also suited for several other interesting astronomical investigations. The system consists of a dual-polarization multi-band feed (with discrete responses corresponding to the 10 bands pre-selected as relatively radio frequency interference free), a common wide-band radio frequency front-end, and independent back-end receiver chains for the 10 individual sub-bands. The raw voltage time sequences corresponding to 16 MHz bandwidth each for the two linear polarization channels and the 10 bands are recorded at the Nyquist rate simultaneously. We present the preliminary results from the tests and pulsar observations carried out with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope using this receiver. The system performance implied by these results and possible improvements are also briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Searches for pulsars in globular clusters during the past few years$\backslash$nhave discovered more than 30 pulsars in 13 clusters. About one-third$\backslash$nof these are located in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (NGC 104),$\backslash$nand were discovered using the Parkes radio telescope in Australia$\backslash$nat an observing frequency of 640 MHz (Manchester et al.). We have$\backslash$nmade further observations of 47 Tucanae at 640 and 436 MHz, with the$\backslash$naim of searching for previously undiscovered pulsars and performing$\backslash$ntiming measurements on the known ones. Here we report the discovery$\backslash$nat 436 MHz of the pulsar 47 Tuc N, but find that 47 Tuc K, earlier$\backslash$nreported by Manchester et al., is non-existent. We present timing$\backslash$nsolutions for the solitary pulsars 47 Tuc C and D. Both pulsars are found$\backslash$nto have negative period derivatives which allow us to put a lower$\backslash$nlimit on the central density of the cluster. We give improved orbital$\backslash$nsolutions for the binary pulsars of 47 Tuc E and J, and show that$\backslash$n47 Tuc J is eclipsed by its companion for about a quarter of the$\backslash$norbital period. A preliminary orbital solution is obtained for the$\backslash$nbinary pulsar 47 Tuc I, which is probably also eclipsing. Finally,$\backslash$nwe discuss the origin and evolution of the 47 Tucanae pulsars.},

A solution found using the force-free approximation would be an interesting standard with which any model with more physics could be compared. Prior quasi-analytic force-free solutions may not be stable, while prior time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic models used unphysical model parameters. We use a time-dependent relativistic force-free electrodynamics code with no free parameters to find a unique stationary solution for the axisymmetric rotating pulsar magnetosphere in a Minkowski space-time in the case of no surface currents on the star. The solution is similar to the force-free quasi-analytic solution of $\backslash$citet{\{}cont99{\}} and the numerical magnetohydrodynamic solution of $\backslash$citet{\{}kom05{\}}. The magnetosphere structure and the usefulness of the classical y-point in the general dissipative regime are discussed.

abstract = {The broadening and depolarization of pulsar average profiles may be due to the birefringence of the plasma above pulsar polar caps. The broadening at low radio frequency is caused by the separation of the individual beams of the two propagation modes, and the depolarization at high frequency results from the merger of their orthogonal polarizations. Observed spectra of pulse width and fractional linear polarization are consistent with this interpretation. Pulse profiles can depolarize rapidly with frequency when the linear polarizations of the beams are comparable. A comparison of the relative frequency of occurrence of the orthogonal modes, as observed in distributions of polarization position angle, with measured rates of depolarization suggests that pulsars depolarize via superposed modes of orthogonal radiation.},

abstract = {Despite the diverse and seemingly complicated structure of the polarization of individual pulses from radio pulsars, many features of the emission are remarkably similar from pulsar to pulsar. These features include the statistical nature of the fluctuations in the emission's intensity and polarization and the ever-present orthogonal modes of polarization. Another persistent, but often neglected, feature of the emission is the wide, Gaussian-like distribution of fractional circular polarization at most pulse longitudes. This unimodal distribution cannot be explained by an emission model that assumes the orthogonal modes of polarization occur separately. However, the proposition that the modes occur simultaneously is consistent with the observations. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the statistics of signal detection for radio polarimetry shows that the observed dispersion in the fractional circular polarization is larger than what one would expect from the instrumental noise or from fluctuations in total intensity. Large, pulsar-intrinsic fluctuations in the circular polarization are required to explain the observed distributions. In an attempt to exploit the general features of the emission and extract information regarding the mode polarizations, a statistical model of superposed modes of orthogonal polarization is extended to include circular polarization. The model attributes the large fluctuations in circular polarization required by the observations to a combination of the heavy modulation of the mode intensities and the small, but significant, degree of circular polarization that is intrinsic to the modes. The results of the model indicate that a small degree of mode-intrinsic circular polarization can explain the large fluctuations in fractional circular polarization that are observed. The general statistics of signal detection for linear polarization are also derived.},

abstract = {The radio sky is relatively unexplored for transient signals, although the potential of radio-transient searches is high. This was demonstrated recently by the discovery of a previously unknown type of source, varying on timescales of minutes to hours. Here we report a search for radio sources that vary on much shorter timescales. We found eleven objects characterized by single, dispersed bursts having durations between 2 and 30 ms. The average time intervals between bursts range from 4 min to 3 h with radio emission typically detectable for {\textless}1 s per day. From an analysis of the burst arrival times, we have identified periodicities in the range 0.4-7 s for ten of the eleven sources, suggesting origins in rotating neutron stars. Despite the small number of sources detected at present, their ephemeral nature implies a total Galactic population significantly exceeding that of the regularly pulsing radio pulsars. Five of the ten sources have periods {\textgreater}4 s, and the rate of change of the pulse period has been measured for three of them; for one source, we have inferred a high magnetic field strength of 5 x 10(13) G. This suggests that the new population is related to other classes of isolated neutron stars observed at X-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of subpulse drifting offers unique insights into the emission geometry of pulsars, and is commonly interpreted in terms of a rotating carousel of "spark" events near the stellar surface. We develop a detailed geometric model for the emission columns above a carousel of sparks that is entirely calculated in the observer's inertial frame, and which is consistent with the well-understood rotational effects of aberration and retardation. We explore the observational consequences of the model, including (1) the appearance of the reconstructed beam pattern via the cartographic transform and (2) the morphology of drift bands and how they might evolve as a function of frequency. The model, which is implemented in the software package PSRGEOM, is applicable to a wide range of viewing geometries, and we illustrate its implications using PSRs B0809+74 and B2034+19 as examples. Some specific predictions are made with respect to the difference between subpulse evolution and microstructure evolution, which provides a way to further test our model.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of subpulse drifting may hold the key to understanding the pulsar emission mechanism. Here, we report on new observations of PSR J0034‑0721 (B0031‑07) carried out with the Murchison Widefield Array at 185 {\{}MHz{\}}. We observe three distinct drift modes whose “vertical” drift band separations (P3) and relative abundances are consistent with previous studies at similar and higher frequencies. The drift bands, however, are observed to change their slopes over the course of individual drift modes, which can be interpreted as a continuously changing drift rate. The implied acceleration of the intrinsic carousel rotation cannot easily be explained by plasma models based on E×B drift. Furthermore, we find that methods of classifying the drift modes by means of P3 measurements can sometimes produce erroneous identifications in the presence of a changing drift rate. The “horizontal” separation between drift bands (P2) is found to be larger at later rotation phases within the pulse window, which is inconsistent with the established effects of retardation, aberration, and the motion of the visible point. Longer observations spanning at least ∼10,000 pulses are required to determine how the carousel rotation parameters change from one drift sequence to the next.},

Attention is given to a qualitative discussion of ALAE, the assumptions and emission formulas in the case of linear acceleration emission, the transfer equation for linear acceleration emission, aspects of amplified linear acceleration emission, and the effect of curved field lines. In applying ALAE to pulsars, the essential features which must be explained are the observed frequency range of emission, the inferred brightness temperatures, and the estimated power radiated.},

abstract = {Properties of the natural wave modes of a pulsar magnetosphere are investigated in a simple way by adopting the 'low-density limit'. Natural-mode properties in this limit are derived for any particle distribution, and the same wave properties are determined explicitly for a cold-plasma model that includes relativistic streaming motions. 'Faraday rotation' of natural-mode components is examined, along with the mechanism responsible for partially circularly polarized emission. The mode separation is estimated which is required by the interpretation of the 'orthogonal modes' of polarization observed in many pulsars in terms of separation into two natural modes. It is suggested that any systematic variation in the observed occurrence of 'orthogonal modes' with frequency should correlate with the pulse separation in double-pulsed pulsars.},

abstract = {We reconsider pulsar electrodynamics for an obliquely rotating pulsar, and propose a way of synthesizing the vacuum dipole model (VDM) and the rotating magnetosphere model (RMM). We first modify the VDM by assuming that the parallel component of the inductive electric field is screened by charges. We refer to the resulting model as the minimal model. We calculate the screening charge density in the minimal model and compare it with the (Goldreich-Julian) charge density in the RMM. We identify the plasma velocity in the minimal model as the electric drift velocity due to the perpendicular component of the inductive electric field. We define a class of synthesized models as a linear combination of a fraction {\$}y{\$} times the minimal model and {\$}1-y{\$} times the RMM. These models require a gap (with {\$}E{\_}\backslashparallel\backslashne0{\$}) between the corotating stellar surface and the non-corotating magnetosphere. We present illustrative plots of the charge density, of the location of nulls (where the charge density is zero) and of the three components of the plasma velocity as a function of the angles ({\$}\backslashtheta,\backslashpsi{\$}) relative to the rotation axis, for specific values of the obliquity $\alpha$ and the parameter {\$}y{\$}. We discuss the question "Can any pulsar magnetosphere be corotating?" critically, pointing out difficulties associated with setting up corotation in the polar cap region. We speculate that the corotating plasma may flow across the last closed field line from the closed-field region. We suggest that abrupt changes in the spin-down rate in some pulsars may be due to jumps between the RMM and the minimal model.},

The response of the plasma leads to a self-consistent electric field that complements the inductive electric field with a potential field leading to an electric drift and a polarization current associated with the total field.

It is pointed out that a form of current starvation also occurs implying a new class of gaps. The properties of gaps are discussed, emphasizing that static models are unstable, the role of large-amplitude longitudinal waves and the azimuthal dependence that arises across a gap in an oblique rotator. Wave dispersion in a pulsar plasma is reviewed briefly, emphasizing its role in radio emission. Pulsar radio emission mechanisms are reviewed, and it is suggested that the most plausible is a form of plasma emission.},

abstract = {We report on simultaneous wideband observations of Crab giant pulses with the Parkes radio telescope and the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The observations were conducted simultaneously at 732 and 3100 MHz with Parkes, and at 120.96, 165.76 and 210.56 MHz with the MWA. Flux density calibration of the MWA data was accomplished using a novel technique based on tied-array beam simulations. We detected between 90-648 giant pulses in the 120.96-210.56 MHz MWA subbands above a {\$} 5.5\backslashsigma {\$} threshold while in the Parkes subbands we detected 6344 and 231 giant pulses above a threshold of {\$} 6\backslashsigma {\$} at 732 and 3100 MHz, respectively. We show, for the first time over a wide frequency range, that the average spectrum of Crab giant pulses exhibits a significant flattening at low frequencies. The spectral index, {\$} \backslashalpha {\$}, for giant pulses evolves from a steep, narrow distribution with a mean {\$} \backslashalpha=-2.6 {\$} and width {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}\backslashalpha=0.5 {\$} between 732 and 3100 MHz, to a wide, flat distribution of spectral indices with a mean {\$} \backslashalpha=-0.7 {\$} and width {\$} \backslashsigma{\_}\backslashalpha=1.4 {\$} between 120.96 and 165.76 MHz.

   abstract = {I summarize the status of pulsar theory, now 35 years after their discovery. Although progress has been made in understanding the relevant processes involved, there are several widely held misconceptions that are inhibiting further advances. These include the idea that plasma "must" be accelerated from the magnetic polar caps (the basis for the "Hollow Cone Model") and the idea that winds would be driven away by centrifugal forces, with large amplitude electromagnetic waves playing no role whatsoever. However, recent theoretical work is converging on a picture that closely resembles the latest HST and Chandra images, providing hope for the future. No less than three groups have recently confirmed the early Krause-Polstorff-Michel simulations showing that the fundamental plasma distribution around a rotating neutron star consists of two polar domes and an equatorial torus of trapped nonneutral plasma of opposite sign charges. Unless a lot of new physics can be added, this distribution renders the Goldreich-Julian model irrelevant (i.e., along with most of the theoretical publications over the last 33 years). © 2004 COSPAR.

abstract = {The process of wide-field synthesis imaging is explored, with the aim of understanding the implications of variable, polarised primary beams for forthcoming Epoch of Reionisation experiments. These experiments seek to detect weak signatures from redshifted 21cm emission in deep residual datasets, after suppression and subtraction of foreground emission. Many subtraction algorithms benefit from low side-lobes and polarisation leakage at the outset, and both of these are intimately linked to how the polarised primary beams are handled. Building on previous contributions from a number of authors, in which direction-dependent corrections are incorporated into visibility gridding kernels, we consider the special characteristics of arrays of fixed dipole antennas operating around 100-200 MHz, looking towards instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA). We show that integrating snapshots in the image domain can help to produce compact gridding kernels, and also reduce the need to make complicated polarised leakage corrections during gridding. We also investigate an alternative form for the gridding kernel that can suppress variations in the direction-dependent weighting of gridded visibilities by 10s of dB, while maintaining compact support.},

abstract = {New Giant Metre-Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of the five-component pulsar B1857-26 provide detailed insight into its pulse-sequence modulation phenomena for the first time. The outer conal components exhibit a 7.4-rotation period, longitude-stationary modulation. Several lines of evidence indicate a carousel circulation time of about 147 stellar rotations, characteristic of a pattern with 20 beamlets. The pulsar nulls some 20 per cent of the time, usually for only a single pulse, and these nulls show no discernible order or periodicity. Finally, the pulsar's polarization-angle traverse raises interesting issues: if most of its emission comprises a single polarization mode, the full traverse exceeds 180° or if both polarization modes are present, then the leading and the trailing halves of the profiles exhibit two different modes. In either case, the rotating-vector model fails to fit the polarization-angle traverse of the core component.},

abstract = {We try to explain the subpulse drift phenomena adopting the space-charge limited flow (SCLF) model and comparing the plasma drift velocity in the inner region of pulsar magnetospheres with the observed velocity of drifting subpulses. We apply the approach described in a recent paper of van Leeuwen {\&} Timokhin (2012), where it was shown that the standard estimation of the subpulse drift velocity through the total value of the scalar potential drop in the inner gap gives inaccurate results, while the exact expression relating the drift velocity to the gradient of the scalar potential should be used instead. After considering a selected sample of sources taken from the catalog of Weltevrede, Edwards {\&} Stappers (2006) with coherently drifting subpulses and reasonably known observing geometry, we show that their subpulse drift velocities would correspond to the drift of the plasma located very close or above the pair formation front. Moreover, a detailed analysis of PSR B0826-34 and PSR B0818-41 reveals that the variation of the subpulse separation with the pulse longitude can be successfully explained by the dependence of the plasma drift velocity on the angular coordinates.},

abstract = {We performed simultaneous observations at 326.5 MHz with the Ooty Radio Telescope and at 326, 610 and 1308 MHz with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope for a sample of 12 pulsars, where frequency dependent single pulse behaviour was reported. The single pulse sequences were analysed with fluctuation analysis, sensitive to both the average fluctuation properties (using longitude resolved fluctuation spectrum and two-dimensional fluctuation spectrum) as well as temporal changes in these (using sliding two-dimensional fluctuation spectrum ) to establish concurrent changes in subpulse drifting over the multiple frequencies employed. We report subpulse drifting in PSR J0934{\$}-{\$}5249 for the first time. We also report pulse nulling measurements in PSRs J0934{\$}-{\$}5249, B1508+55, J1822{\$}-{\$}2256, B1845{\$}-{\$}19 and J1901{\$}-{\$}0906 for the first time. Our measurements of subpulse drifting and pulse nulling for the rest of the pulsars are consistent with previously reported values. Contrary to previous belief, we find no evidence for a frequency dependent drift pattern in PSR B2016+28 implied by non-simultaneous observations by Oster et al. (1977). In PSRs B1237+25, J1822{\$}-{\$}2256, J1901{\$}-{\$}0906 and B2045{\$}-{\$}16, our longer and more sensitive observations reveal multiple drift rates with distinct P3. We increase the sample of pulsars showing concurrent nulling across multiple frequencies by more than 100 percent, adding 4 more pulsars to this sample. Our results confirm and further strengthen the understanding that the subpulse drifting and pulse nulling are broadband consistent with previous studies (Gajjar et al. 2014a; Rankin 1986; Weltevrede et al. 2007) and are closely tied to physics of polar gap.},

abstract = {We employ hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for the low levels of gas and dust in globular clusters. Our models examine the competing effects of mass supply from the evolved stellar population and energy injection from the main sequence stellar members for globular clusters 47 Tucanae, M15, NGC 6440, and NGC 6752. Disregarding all other gas evacuation processes, we find that the energy output from the main sequence stellar population alone is capable of effectively clearing the evolved stellar ejecta and producing intracluster gas densities consistent with current observational constraints. This result distinguishes a viable ubiquitous gas and dust evacuation mechanism for globular clusters. In addition, we extend our analysis to probe the efficiency of pulsar wind feedback in globular clusters. The detection of intracluster ionized gas in cluster 47 Tucanae allows us to place particularly strict limits on pulsar wind thermalization efficiency, which must be extremely low in the cluster's core in order to be in accordance with the observed density constraints.},

abstract = {We provide a status report on our current understanding of the mass scales for Pop III.1 and Pop III.2 stars. Since the last review (Norman 2008), substantial progress has been made both numerically and analytically on the late stages of protostellar cloud core collapse, protostar formation and accretion, and stellar evolution taking into account cloud core properties and radiative feedback effects. Based on this, there are growing indications that primordial stars forming from purely cosmological initial conditions (Pop III.1) were substantially more massive than stars forming in preionized gas (Pop III.2) where HD cooling is important. Different stellar endpoints are predicted for these two types of Pop III stars with different chemical enrichment signatures: the former die as pair instability supernovae or intermediate mass black holes, whereas the latter die as iron core-collapse supernovae, leaving behind neutron star and stellar black hole remnants. We review recent simulations which show evidence for binary fragmentation at high densities, and comment on the significance of these results. We then summarize an attempt to directly calculate the Pop III.1 IMF taking into account the latest numerical and analytical models. We conclude with suggestions for the kind of simulations needed next to continue improving our understanding of Pop III star formation, which is a necessary input to understanding high redshift galaxy formation.},

abstract = {We present the highest-quality polarisation profiles to date of 16 non-recycled pulsars and four millisecond pulsars, observed below 200 MHz with the LOFAR high-band antennas. Based on the observed profiles, we perform an initial investigation of expected observational effects resulting from the propagation of polarised emission in the pulsar magnetosphere and the interstellar medium. The predictions of magnetospheric birefringence in pulsars have been tested using spectra of the pulse width and fractional polarisation from multifrequency data. The derived spectra offer only partial support for the expected effects of birefringence on the polarisation properties, with only about half of our sample being consistent with the model's predictions. It is noted that for some pulsars these measurements are contaminated by the effects of interstellar scattering. For a number of pulsars in our sample, we have observed significant variations in the amount of Faraday rotation as a function of pulse phase, which is possibly an artefact of scattering. These variations are typically two orders of magnitude smaller than that observed at 1400 MHz by Noutsos et al. (2009), for a different sample of southern pulsars. In this paper we present a possible explanation for the difference in magnitude of this effect between the two frequencies, based on scattering. Finally, we have estimated the magnetospheric emission heights of low-frequency radiation from four pulsars, based on the phase lags between the flux-density and the PA profiles, and the theoretical framework of Blaskiewicz, Cordes {\&} Wasserman (1991). These estimates yielded heights of a few hundred km; at least for PSR B1133+16, this is consistent with emission heights derived based on radius-to-frequency mapping, but is up to a few times larger than the recent upper limit based on pulsar timing.},

abstract = {We report on observations of giant pulses from the Crab pulsar performed simultaneously with the Parkes radio telescope and the incoherent combination of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) antenna tiles. The observations were performed over a duration of approximately one hour at a center frequency of 1382 MHz with 340 MHz bandwidth at Parkes, and at a center frequency of 193 MHz with 15 MHz bandwidth at the MWA. Our analysis has led to the detection of 55 giant pulses at the MWA and 2075 at Parkes above a threshold of 3.5$\sigma$ and 6.5$\sigma$, respectively. We detected 51{\%} of the MWA giant pulses at the Parkes radio telescope, with spectral indices in the range of -3.6$\backslash$gt $\alpha$ $\backslash$gt -4.9 ({\{}S{\}}$\nu$ $\backslash$propto {\{}$\nu$ {\}}$\alpha$ ). We present a Monte Carlo analysis supporting the conjecture that the giant pulse emission in the Crab is intrinsically broadband, the less than 100{\%} correlation being due to the relative sensitivities of the two instruments and the width of the spectral index distribution. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the spectral index of giant pulses is drawn from normal distribution of standard deviation 0.6, but with a mean that displays an evolution with frequency from -3.00 at 1382 MHz, to -2.85 at 192 MHz.},

The bright pulses show a tendency to appear consecutively. The observations found two groups of six consecutive bright pulses and many groups of two to five bright pulses in a row. The strong radio emission process that produces the six bright pulses lasts between 0.4 and 0.6 s. The numbers of bright pulses in sequence far exceed what would be expected if individual bright pulses were independent random events.

The authors focus on shape interrogation of geometric models bounded by free-form surfaces. Free-form surfaces, also called sculptured surfaces, are widely used in the bodies of ships, automobiles and aircraft, which have both functionality and attractive shape requirements. Many electronic devices as well as consumer products are designed with aesthetic shapes, which involve free-form surfaces. This book provides the mathematical fundamentals as well as algorithms for various shape interrogation methods. From the reviews: "This book provides the mathematical fundamentals as well as algorithms for various shape interrogation methods including nonlinear polynomial solvers, intersection problems, differential geometry of intersection curves, distance functions, curve and surface interrogation, umbilics and lines of curvature, geodesics, and offset curves and surfaces. [... ] It may well be one of the most important books of the 2002s that has been written on shape interrogation for graduate students in mathematics, engineering, computer science, focusing on geometrical modeling and solid modeling. The book will inform and enlighten professionals in industry and therefore remains essential reading for them too. Currently there are several excellent books in the area of geometric modeling and in the area of solid modeling. The major contribution of this book lies in its skilful manner of providing a bridge between these two areas that is guaranteed to make the target audience cry out aloud with delight."Current Engineering Practice 2002-2003, Vol. 45, Issue 3-4 "This book gives a detailed description of algorithms and computational methods for shape interrogation [... ] The book can be used in a course for advanced graduate students and also as a reference text for researchers and practitioners in CAD/CAM.

Shape interrogation and computational geometry of freeform shapes have been a part of the geometric design and manufacturing community for a long time. This book makes efforts and is likely to become the 'Bible' for this area.

abstract = {Neutron stars are fascinating astrophysical objects immersed in strong gravitational and electromagnetic fields, at the edge of our current theories. These stars manifest themselves mostly as pulsars, emitting a timely very stable and regular electromagnetic signal. Even though discovered almost fifty years ago, they still remain mysterious compact stellar objects. In this review, we summarize the most fundamental theoretical aspects of neutron star magnetospheres and winds. The main competing models susceptible to explain their radiative properties like multi-wavelength pulse shapes and spectra and the underlying physical processes such as pair creation and radiation mechanisms are scrutinized. A global but still rather qualitative picture emerges slowly thanks to recent advances in numerical simulations on the largest scales. However considerations about pulsar magnetospheres remain speculative. For instance the exact composition of the magnetospheric plasma is not yet known. Is it solely filled with a mixture of {\$}e{\^{}}\backslashpm{\$}{\~{}}leptons, or does it contain a non negligible fraction of protons and/or ions? Actually, is it almost entirely filled or mostly empty except for some small anecdotal plasma filled regions? Answers to these questions will strongly direct the description of the magnetosphere to seemingly contradictory results leading sometimes to inconsistencies. Nevertheless, account are given to the latest developments in the theory of pulsar magnetospheres and winds, the existence of a possible electrosphere and physical insight obtained from related observational signatures of multi-wavelength pulsed emission.},

abstract = {Radio polarization measurements of pulsed emission from pulsars offer a valuable insight into the basic geometry of the neutron star: inclination angle between the magnetic and rotation axis and inclination of the line of sight. So far, all studies about radio polarization focused on the standard rotating vector model with the underlying assumption of a centred dipole. In this letter, we extend this model to the most general off-centred dipole configuration and give an exact closed analytic expression for the phase-resolved polarization angle. It is shown that contrary to the rotating vector model, for an off-centred dipole, the polarization angle also depends on the emission altitude. Although the fitting parameter space increases from two to six (position of the dipole, altitude and shift of the zero phase), statistical analysis should remain tractable. Observations revealing an evolution of the polarization angle with frequency would undeniably furnish a strong hint for the presence of a decentred magnetic dipole in neutron stars.},

In fact, their similarity to FRB 010724 had previously cast a shadow over the interpretation of "fast radio bursts," which otherwise appear to be of extragalactic origin. Until now, the physical origin of the dispersion-mimicking perytons had remained a mystery. We have identified strong out-of-band emission at 2.3--2.5 GHz associated with several peryton events. Subsequent tests revealed that a peryton can be generated at 1.4 GHz when a microwave oven door is opened prematurely and the telescope is at an appropriate relative angle. Radio emission escaping from microwave ovens during the magnetron shut-down phase neatly explain all of the observed properties of the peryton signals. Now that the peryton source has been identified, we furthermore demonstrate that the microwaves on site could not have caused FRB 010724. This and other distinct observational differences show that FRBs are excellent candidates for genuine extragalactic transients.},

abstract = {In this paper we compile the analysis of {\~{}} 200 synchrotron flare events from {\~{}} 90 distinct objects/events for which the distance is well established, and hence the peak luminosity can be accurately estimated. For each event we measure this peak and compare it to the rise and decay timescales, as fit by exponential functions, which allows us in turn to estimate a minimum brightness temperature for all the events. The astrophysical objects from which the flares originate vary from flare stars to supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei, and include both repeating phenomena and single cataclysmic events (such as supernovae and gamma ray burst afterglows). The measured timescales vary from minutes to longer than years, and the peak radio luminosities range over 22 orders of magnitude. Despite very different underlying phenomena, including relativistic and non-relativistic regimes, and highly collimated versus isotropic phenomena, we find a broad correlation between peak radio luminosity and rise/decay timescales, approximately of the form L {\~{}} t{\^{}}5. This rather unexpectedly demonstrates that the estimated minimum brightness temperature, when based upon variability timescales, and with no attempt to correct for relativistic boosting, is a strongly rising function of source luminosity. It furthermore demonstrates that variability timescales could be used as an early diagnostic of source class in future radio transient surveys. As an illustration of radio transients parameter space, we compare the synchrotron events with coherent bursts at higher brightness temperatures to illustrate which regions of radio transient parameter space have been explored.},

abstract = {LOFAR offers the unique capability of observing pulsars across the 10-240 MHz frequency range with a fractional bandwidth of roughly 50{\%}. This spectral range is well-suited for studying the frequency evolution of pulse profile morphology caused by both intrinsic and extrinsic effects: such as changing emission altitude in the pulsar magnetosphere or scatter broadening by the interstellar medium, respectively. The magnitude of most of these effects increases rapidly towards low frequencies. LOFAR can thus address a number of open questions about the nature of radio pulsar emission and its propagation through the interstellar medium. We present the average pulse profiles of 100 pulsars observed in the two LOFAR frequency bands: High Band (120-167 MHz, 100 profiles) and Low Band (15-62 MHz, 26 profiles). We compare them with Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) and Lovell Telescope observations at higher frequencies (350 and1400 MHz) in order to study the profile evolution. The profiles are aligned in absolute phase by folding with a new set of timing solutions from the Lovell Telescope, which we present along with precise dispersion measures obtained with LOFAR. We find that the profile evolution with decreasing radio frequency does not follow a specific trend but, depending on the geometry of the pulsar, new components can enter into, or be hidden from, view. Nonetheless, in general our observations confirm the widening of pulsar profiles at low frequencies, as expected from radius-to-frequency mapping or birefringence theories. We offer this catalog of low-frequency pulsar profiles in a user friendly way via the EPN Database of Pulsar Profiles (http://www.epta.eu.org/epndb/).},

abstract = {A digital receiver at the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) processes signal from eight MWA tiles for a band between 80 and 300 MHz. The digitized outputs are processed in the digital receiver using a polyphase filter bank to get a 1.28 MHz wide sub-bands. During a nor- mal operation, 24 such sub-bands (corresponding to a 30.72 MHz band) are selected and sent out for processing in an FX correlator. To facilitate sensitive targeted searches and fast transient observations with the MWA, the digital receiver is enhanced to form a new mode, where a voltage beam is formed across the 80 to 300 MHz band. The digital receiver's data path and the firmware logic are enhanced to achieve this mode. The enhanced digital receiver can phase the full-band signals from eight tiles to form the voltage beams at each station. Now, the development of this beamformer mode to the MWA digital receiver is complete, and the new functional- ity is being tested in the lab. We present here briefly an introduction, the implementation of the new mode, the current status and the future plans.},

abstract = {An FPGA-based digital-receiver has been developed for a low-frequency imaging radio interferometer, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The MWA, located at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in Western Australia, consists of 128 dual-polarized aperture-array elements (tiles) operating between 80 and 300$\backslash$,MHz, with a total processed bandwidth of 30.72 MHz for each polarization. Radio-frequency signals from the tiles are amplified and band limited using analog signal conditioning units; sampled and channelized by digital-receivers. The signals from eight tiles are processed by a single digital-receiver, thus requiring 16 digital-receivers for the MWA. The main function of the digital-receivers is to digitize the broad-band signals from each tile, channelize them to form the sky-band, and transport it through optical fibers to a centrally located correlator for further processing. The digital-receiver firmware also implements functions to measure the signal power, perform power equalization across the band, detect interference-like events, and invoke diagnostic modes. The digital-receiver is controlled by high-level programs running on a single-board-computer. This paper presents the digital-receiver design, implementation, current status, and plans for future enhancements.},

abstract = {HIPSR (HI-Pulsar) is a digital signal processing system for the Parkes 21-cm Multibeam Receiver that provides larger instantaneous bandwidth, increased dynamic range, and more signal processing power than the previous systems in use at Parkes. The additional computational capacity enables finer spectral resolution in wideband HI observations and real-time detection of Fast Radio Bursts during pulsar surveys. HIPSR uses a heterogeneous architecture, consisting of FPGA-based signal processing boards connected via high-speed Ethernet to high performance compute nodes. Low-level signal processing is conducted on the FPGA-based boards, and more complex signal processing routines are conducted on the GPU-based compute nodes. The development of HIPSR was driven by two main science goals: to provide large bandwidth, high-resolution spectra suitable for 21-cm stacking and intensity mapping experiments; and to upgrade the Berkeley-Parkes-Swinburne Recorder (BPSR), the signal processing system used for the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) Survey and the Survey for Pulsars and Extragalactic Radio Bursts (SUPERB).},

abstract = {A new drifting pulsar, PSR J0815+09, was discovered in the Arecibo drift-scan searches. An intriguing feature of this source is that within the four pulse components in the integrated pulse profile, the subpulse drifting direction in the two leading components is opposite from that in the two trailing components. In the view that the leading theoretical model for pulsar subpulse drifting can only interpret one-direction subpulse drifting, the observed bi-drifting phenomenon from PSR J0815+09 poses a great challenge to the pulsar theory. The inner annular gap (IAG), a new type of inner particle accelerator, was recently proposed to explain both gamma-ray and radio emission from pulsars. Here we show that the coexistence of the IAG and the conventional inner core gap offers a natural interpretation to the bi-drifting phenomenon. In particular, the peculiar drifting behavior in PSR J0815+09 can be reproduced within the inverse Compton scattering model for pulsar radio emission.},

abstract = {The circular polarization associated with pulsar emission is examined phenomenologically. Virtually all circular polarization is observed in core components - that is, in core-single profiles and in the central components of triple and five-component profiles. Two extreme types of circular signature are identified in the observations: (1) an antisymmetric type wherein the circular polarization changes sense in midpulse, and (2) a symmetric type wherein it is predominantly of one sense. It is found that circular polarization of the antisymmetric type is strongly correlated with the sense of rotation of the linear position angle. Transitions from positive (LH) to negative (RH) are found to accompany negative (clockwise) rotations of the position angle and vice versa. The correlation requires that the antisymmetric circular polarization is also a purely geometric property of the emission process. Curvature radiation will have significant net circular polarization if there are gradients in the emissivity over angular scales comparable with the emission cone of a single charge. Furthermore, no net circular polarization is produced if the emissivity is circularly symmetric about the magnetic dipole axis.},

abstract = {Most of the known pulsars are sources of highly linearly polarized radiation. Faraday rotation in the intervening medium rotates the plane of the linear polarization as the signals propagate through the medium. The Rotation Measure (RM), which quantifies the amount of such rotation as a function of wavelength, is useful in studying the properties of the medium and in recovering the intrinsic polarization characteristics of the pulsar signal. Conventional methods for polarization measurements use telescopes equipped with dual orthogonally polarized feeds that allow estimation of all 4 Stokes parameters. Some telescopes (such as the Ooty Radio Telescope) that offer high sensitivity for pulsar observations may however be receptive to only a single linear polarization. In such a case, the apparent spectral intensity modulation, resulting from differential Faraday rotation of the linearly polarized signal component within the observing bandwidth, can be exploited to estimate the RM as well as to study the linear polarization properties of the source. In this paper, we present two improved procedures by which these observables can be estimated reliably from the intensity modulation over large bandwidths, particularly at low radio frequencies. We also highlight some other applications where such measurements and procedures would be useful.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Profile mode changing is studied as a reorganization of core and conal emission, and it is shown that modal changes of the average profile prototypically occur in pulsars having triple or multiple profiles. It is demonstrated that drifting subpulses are associated with conal emission, and that stars which prototypically exhibit the drifting subpulse phenomenon all have conal single profiles wherein the sight line traverses the conal emission lobe tangentially. Finally, it is shown that, within a given profile class, stars which null are no older than those which do not, and the null fraction does not seem to increase with age. Pulsars thus do not null simply by virtue of their age.},

abstract = {A nearly coherent sequence of ``drifting" pulses from PSR B0943+10 has led us to develop a technique for mapping the pattern of polar-cap ``storms" or ``sparks" responsible for its emission. We have developed procedures which compute both this ``cartographic" transform and its inverse, in order first to study the character of the polar-cap emission ``map" and then to confirm that this ``map" in turn reproduces the observed pulse sequence. The application of this technique to pulsar 0943+10 and to other pulsars with regular patterns of subpulse emission provides a basis for assessing the physical origins of ``drifting" subpulse emission---which in turn is one of the most carefully articulated aspects of the Ruderman {\&} Sutherland (1975) theory. We have studied 0943+10 pulse sequences in both the bright ``B" (profile) mode and ``quiescent" ``Q" mode, and our accurate polarimetric observations at both 430 and 111.5 MHz show that the pulse train is comprised of different polarization-modal contributions. On this basis, we have computed polar-cap emission ``maps" corresponding to these different observations and modal sequences. We find that, strangely, most of the emission comes from the part of the polar cap prior to the magnetic axis, and this circumstance raises the possibility of propagation effects (absorption and/or refraction) within the pulsar magnetosphere which may be responsible for the ``absorption" phenomenon. We further find that pulsar 0943+10 is an ``antipulsar", contrary to the expectations of Ruderman {\&} Sutherland, but has an inside (poleward) sight-line traverse as favored by Arons {\&} Scharlemann (1979). A number of other pulsars are known with highly regular patterns of subpulse modulation, and this number is likely to increase as the interrupting effect of pulse nulling is better understood. Pulsars with central sight-line traverses, such as B1237+25 or B1919+21, also provide illuminating objects of study.},

As the star's profiles are truncated by “absorption” over a broad band, most severely between some 60 and 1500 MHz, the analysis also provides quantitative estimates of the extent of this effect at each frequency. The model's predicted scales are found to agree closely with those determined by correlating pulse sequences observed simultaneously in different bands and by measuring P2 at different frequencies.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to suggest how detailed single-pulse observations of ``slow'' radio pulsars may be utilized to construct an empirical model for their emission. It links the observational synthesis developed in a series of papers by Rankin starting in the 1980s to the more recent empirical feedback model of Wright (2003a) by regarding the entire pulsar magnetosphere as a non-steady, non-linear interactive system with a natural built-in delay. It is argued that the enhanced role of the outer gap in such a system indicates an evolutionary link to younger pulsars, in which this region is thought to be highly active, and that pulsar magnetospheres should no longer be seen as being ``driven'' by events on the neutron star's polar cap, but as having more in common with planetary magnetospheres and auroral phenomena.},

abstract = {Arecibo observations of the conal triple pulsar B1918+19 at 0.327- and 1.4-GHz are used to analyse its subpulse behaviour in detail. We confirm the presence of three distinct drift modes (A,B,C) plus a disordered mode (N) and show that they follow one another in specific cycles. Interpreting the pulsar's profile as resulting from a sightline traverse which cuts across an outer cone and tangentially grazes an inner cone, we demonstrate that the phase modulation of the inner cone is locked to the amplitude modulation of the outer cone in all the drift modes. The 9{\%} nulls are found to be largely confined to the dominant B and N modes, and, in the N mode, create alternating bunches of nulls and emission in a quasi-periodic manner with an averaged fluctuation rate of about 12 rotation periods ({\$}P{\_}1{\$}). We explore the assumption that the apparent drift is the first alias of a faster drift of subbeams equally spaced around the cones. This is shown to imply that all modes A, B and C have a common circulation time of 12 {\$}P{\_}1{\$} and differ only in the number of subbeams. This timescale is on the same order as predicted by the classic {\{}$\backslash$bf E{\}}{\$}\backslashtimes{\$}{\{}$\backslash$bf B{\}} drift and also coincides with the N-mode modulation. We therefore arrive at a picture where the circulation speed remains roughly invariant while the subbeams progressively diminish in number from modes A to B to C, and are then re-established during the N mode. We suggest that aliasing combined with subbeam loss may be responsible for apparently dramatic changes in drift rates in other pulsars.},

abstract = {We present an assortment of both standard and advanced Fourier techniques that are useful in the analysis of astrophysical time series of very long duration-where the observation time is much greater than the time resolution of the individual data points. We begin by reviewing the operational characteristics of Fourier transforms of time-series data, including power-spectral statistics, discussing some of the differences between analyses of binned data, sampled data, and event data, and we briefly discuss algorithms for calculating discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) of very long time series. We then discuss the response of DFTs to periodic signals and present techniques to recover Fourier amplitude ``lost'' during simple traditional analyses if the periodicities change frequency during the observation. These techniques include Fourier interpolation, which allows us to correct the response for signals that occur between Fourier frequency bins. We then present techniques for estimating additional signal properties such as the signal's centroid and duration in time, the first and second derivatives of the frequency, the pulsed fraction, and an overall estimate of the significance of a detection. Finally, we present a recipe for a basic but thorough Fourier analysis of a time series for well-behaved pulsations.},

abstract = {Gravitationally bound three-body systems have been studied for hundreds of years and are common in our Galaxy. They show complex orbital interactions, which can constrain the compositions, masses and interior structures of the bodies and test theories of gravity, if sufficiently precise measurements are available. A triple system containing a radio pulsar could provide such measurements, but the only previously known such system, PSR B1620-26 (refs 7, 8; with a millisecond pulsar, a white dwarf, and a planetary-mass object in an orbit of several decades), shows only weak interactions. Here we report precision timing and multiwavelength observations of PSR J0337+1715, a millisecond pulsar in a hierarchical triple system with two other stars. Strong gravitational interactions are apparent and provide the masses of the pulsar M[Symbol: see text](1.4378(13), where M[Symbol: see text]is the solar mass and the parentheses contain the uncertainty in the final decimal places) and the two white dwarf companions (0.19751(15)M[Symbol: see text] and 0.4101(3))M[Symbol: see text], as well as the inclinations of the orbits (both about 39.2°). The unexpectedly coplanar and nearly circular orbits indicate a complex and exotic evolutionary past that differs from those of known stellar systems. The gravitational field of the outer white dwarf strongly accelerates the inner binary containing the neutron star, and the system will thus provide an ideal laboratory in which to test the strong equivalence principle of general relativity.},

abstract = {We present a new dynamical scenario for the formation of short-period binary millisecond pulsars in globular clusters. Our work is motivated by the recent observations of 20 radio pulsars in 47 Tuc. In a dense cluster such as 47 Tuc, most neutron stars acquire binary companions through exchange interactions with primordial binaries. The resulting systems have semimajor axes in the range {\~{}}0.1-1 AU and neutron star companion masses {\~{}}1-3 M ☉ . For many of these systems, we find that when the companion evolves off the main sequence and fills its Roche lobe, the subsequent mass transfer is dynamically unstable. This leads to a common envelope phase and the formation of short-period neutron star-white dwarf binaries. For a significant fraction of these binaries, the decay of the orbit due to gravitational radiation will be followed by a period of stable mass transfer driven by a combination of gravitational radiation and tidal heating of the companion. The properties of the resulting short-period binaries match well those of observed binary pulsars in 47 Tuc.},

Previous studies have shown that the emission from some pulsars occasionally decreases dramatically for a few periods before returning to normal. This effect is known as pulse nulling. An estimate is made of the fraction of time spent by each of the observed pulsars in the nulled state, and it is found that pulse nulling is a characteristic of pulsar old age. There is no evidence for any pulsar emission during a null. An autocorrelation analysis performed on the data indicates that the radiation from pulsars is generated in bursts of typically 50 pulses. It is suggested that pulse nulls correspond to the time intervals between these bursts and that the bursts occur less frequently as a pulsar grows older. A pulsar will then effectively die when the separation of the bursts becomes much larger than their duration.},

abstract = {Several consequences are derived for a neutron star whose magnetic moment tends to be antiparallel to its spin angular momentum, when emitted electrons do not return to the star through the light cylinder along the open field lines. A polar magnetospheric gap is formed that spans the open field lines from the stellar surface up to an altitude of about 10,000 cm. The scalar product of the electric and magnetic fields is nonzero in the gap, although it vanishes essentially everywhere else in the near magnetosphere. The potential difference between the base and the top of the gap is about 1 trillion volts. The gap continually breaks down by forming electron-positron pairs on a time scale of a few microseconds. The gap positrons move out along the open field lines and electrons flow to the stellar surface to close the pulsar's homopolar generator circuit. The proposed model can explain many characteristics of the coherent microwave radiation observed from pulsars.},

abstract = {We present realistic models for massive Population III stars and stellar populations based on non-LTE model atmospheres, recent stellar evolution tracks and up-to-date evolutionary synthesis models, to study their spectral properties, including their dependence on age, star formation history, and IMF. (..) The main results regarding integrated stellar populations are: * For young bursts and the case of a constant SFR, nebular continuous emission - neglected in previous studies - dominates the spectrum redward of Lyman-alpha (...). Therefore predicted emission line equivalent widths are considerably smaller than found in earlier studies, whereas the detection of the continuum is eased. Nebular line and continuous emission strongly affect the broad band photometric properties of Pop III objects. * Due to stellar evolution, the hardness of the ionising spectrum decreases rapidly, leading to the disappearance of the characteristic HeII 1640 recombination lines after {\~{}} 3 Myr in instantaneous bursts. * The relative efficiency of ionising photon energy to heavy element rest mass production, eta, of metal-poor and metal-free populations is increased by factors of {\~{}} 4 to 18 with respect to solar metallicity and for ``standard'' IMFs. * The lowest values of eta {\~{}} 1.6 - 2.2 {\%} are obtained for IMFs exclusively populated with high mass stars (M{\_}low {\textgreater}{\~{}} 50 Msun). If correct, the yields dominated by pair creation SNae then predict large overabundances of O/C and Si/C compared to solar abundance ratios. Detailed results are given in tabular form and as fit formulae for implementation in other calculations. (abridged abstract)},

abstract = {We introduce a new technique, called the Sliding Two-Dimensional Fluctuation Spectrum, used for detecting and characterising the temporal changes of drifting subpulses from radio pulsars. The method was tested using simulated data as well as archived observations made with the WSRT at wavelengths of 92 and 21 cm. The drifting subpulse phenomenon is a well known property of radio pulsars. However the properties of the temporal behaviour of drifting subpulses are not fully explored. The drifting can also be non-coherent and the presence of effects like nulling or drift rate changing can mask the drifting behaviour of the pulsar. The S2DFS is a robust method for investigating this phenomenon and by introducing it we aim to expand our knowledge of the temporal drifting subpulse properties. Our new analysis method uses horizonally collapsed fluctuation spectra obtained with the Two-Dimensional Fluctuation Spectrum method. Stacking the collapsed spectra obtained in a 256 pulse window which slides by a pulse at a time produces a map of the collapsed fluctuation spectrum. By analysing the maps one can easily determine the presence of any temporal drift changes. Simulated data showed that the technique can reveal the presence of any temporal changes in drift behaviour like mode changing or nulling. We have also analysed data of three pulsars, PSRs B0031-07, B1819-22 and B1944+17, which were selected based on the quality of the data and their known drift properties. All three sources are known to exhibit mode changes which could easily be seen in the S2DFS. The results from the analysis of the data sets used in this paper have shown that the S2DFS method is robust and complimentary to the 2DFS method in detecting and characterising the temporal changes in drifting subpulses from radio pulsars.},

Using techniques that allow us to re-sample the original measurements without losing structural information, we have searched for evidence of a strange attractor in the time series of frequency derivatives for each of the 17 pulsars. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by applying them to a component of the Lorenz and R{\"{o}}ssler attractors that were sampled with similar cadence to the pulsar time series. Our measurements of correlation dimension and Lyapunov exponent show that the underlying behaviour appears to be driven by a strange attractor with approximately three governing non-linear differential equations.

abstract = {Using results of nucleosynthesis calculations for theoretical core-collapse supernova models with various progenitor's masses, it is shown that abundance patterns of C, Mg, Si, Ca, and H seen in extremely metal-deficient stars with [Fe/H] {\textless} -2.5 follow those seen in the individual first generation supernova remnants (SNRs). This suggests that most of the stars with [Fe/H] {\textless} -2.5 were made from individual supernova (SN) events. To obtain the ratio of heavy elements to hydrogen, a formula is derived to estimate the mass of hydrogen swept up by a SNR when it occurs in the interstellar matter with the primordial abundances. We use [Mg/H] to indicate the metallicities instead of [Fe/H]. The metallicities [Mg/H] predicted from these SNRs range from {\~{}}-4 to {\~{}}-1.5 and the mass of Mg in a SN is well correlated with its progenitor's mass. Thus the observed [Mg/H] in an extremely metal deficient star has a correspondence to the progenitor's mass. A larger [Mg/H] corresponds to a larger progenitor's mass. Therefore, so called `age-metallicity relation' does not hold for stars with [Fe/H] {\textless} -2.5. In contrast, the [Mg/Fe] ratios in the theoretical SNRs have a different trend from those in extremely metal-deficient stars. It is also shown that the observed trend of [Mg/Fe] can predict the Fe yield of each SN given the correspondence of [Mg/H] to the progenitor's mass. The Fe yields thus obtained are consistent with those derived from SN light curve analyses. This indicates that there is still a problem in modelling a core-collapse supernova at its beginning of explosion or mass cut.},

The observations were conducted at a spacecraft distance of 330,000 km, resulting in a projected baseline of 220,000 km, providing the greatest angular resolution ever achieved at meter wavelengths. Our analysis is based on fundamental behavior of structure and coherence functions. We find that the pulsar shows scintillation on two frequency scales, both much less than the observing frequency; but modulation is less than 100{\%}. We infer that the scattering is weak, but a refracting wedge disperses the scintillation pattern. The refraction angle of this "cosmic prism" is measured as theta{\_}0=1.1 - 4.4 mas, with the refraction direction being approximately perpendicular to the observer velocity. We show that the observed parameters of scintillation effects indicate that two plasma layers lie along the line of sight to the pulsar, at distances of 4.4 - 16.4 pc and 26 - 170 pc, and traveling in different directions relative to the line of sight. Spectra of turbulence for the two layers are found to follow a power law with the indices gamma{\_}1 = gamma{\_}2 = 3.00 +/- 0.08, significantly different from the index expected for a Kolmogorov spectrum of turbulence, gamma=11/3.},

We have investigated periodicities and polarisation properties of PSR B0031-07 for a sequence of 2700 single pulses taken simultaneously at 328 MHz and 4.85 GHz. We found that mode A occurs simultaneously at these frequencies, while modes B and C only occur at 328 MHz. However, when the pulsar is emitting in mode B at the lower frequency there is still emission at the higher frequency, hinting towards the presence of mode B emission at a weaker level. Further, we have established that modes A and B are associated with two orthogonal modes of polarisation, respectively. Based on these observations, we suggest a geometrical model where modes A and B at a given frequency are emitted in two concentric rings around the magnetic axis with mode B being nested inside mode A. Further, it is evident that this nested configuration is preserved across frequency with the higher frequency arising closer to the stellar surface compared to the lower one, consistent with the well known radius-to-frequency mapping operating in pulsars.},

abstract = {PSR B0031-07 is well known to exhibit three different modes of drifting sub-pulses (mode A, B and C). It has recently been shown that in a multifrequency observation, consisting of 2700 pulses, all driftmodes were visible at low frequencies, while at 4.85 GHz only mode-A drift or non-drifting emission was detected. This suggests that modes A and B are emitted in sub-beams, rotating at a fixed distance from the magnetic axis, with the mode-B sub-beams being closer to the magnetic axis than the mode-A sub-beams. Diffuse emission between the sub-beams can account for the non-drifting emission. Using the results of an analysis of simultaneous multifrequency observations of PSR B0031-07, we set out to construct a geometrical model that includes emission from both sub-beams and diffuse emission and describes the regions of the radio emission of PSR B0031-07 at each emission frequency for driftmodes A and B. Based on the vertical spacing between driftbands, we have determined the driftmode of each sequence of drift. To restrict the model, we calculated average polarisation and intensity characteristics for each driftmode and at each frequency. The model reproduces the observed polarisation and intensity characteristics, suggesting that diffuse emission plays an important role in the emission properties of PSR B0031-07. The model further suggests that the emission heights of this pulsar range from a few kilometers to a little over 10 kilometers above the pulsar surface. We also find that the relationships between height and frequency of emission that follow from curvature radiation and from plasma-frequency emission could not be used to reproduce the observed frequency dependence of the width of the average intensity profiles.},

abstract = {We have monitored the radio flux density of 21 pulsars on a daily basis for five years. The 610 MHz flux density time series for these pulsars range from nearly constant for the most distant and heavily scattered pulsars to rapidly varying, saturated time series for more nearby pulsars. The measured stability of the flux density from the most distant pulsars (variations less than 5{\%}) implies that the average radio emission from pulsars, before it has been affected by propagation through the interstellar medium, is constant in strength on timescales of a few hours to several years. The modulation index of the flux density variations never exceeds 0.5, ruling out a density inhomogeneity spectrum with a steep power-law exponent ($\beta${\textgreater}4). The flux density variations for 15 of the pulsars are consistent with a Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum over a range of more than 5 orders of magnitude in scattering strength, with no detectable presence of an inner scale. For these lines of sight we constrain the inhomogeneity slope to be in the range 3.5{\textless}=$\beta${\textless}=3.7, which brackets the Kolmogorov value of $\beta$=3.67. The flux density variations are greater than predicted by this model for six pulsars-including the Crab and Vela-but this group is consistent with a Kolmogorov spectrum and an inner scale of {\~{}}1010 cm. The lines of sight to three of the other pulsars in this group pass through H II regions around young, hot stars. For six pulsars we have found a change in the slope of the intensity structure function, which could be connected with a change in the slope of the inhomogeneity power spectrum at a scale of {\~{}}1013 cm.},

abstract = {We perform stellar evolution simulation of first stars and calculate stellar yields from the first supernovae. The initial masses are taken from 12 to 140 Msun to cover the whole range of core-collapse supernova progenitors, and stellar rotation is included, which results in efficient internal mixing. A weak explosion is assumed in supernova yield calculations, thus only outer distributed matter, which is not affected by the explosive nucleosynthesis, is ejected in the models. We show that the initial mass and the rotation affect the explosion yield. All the weak explosion models have abundances of [C/O] larger than unity. Stellar yields from massive progenitors of {\textgreater} 40-60 Msun show enhancement of Mg and Si. Rotating models yield abundant Na and Al. And Ca is synthesized in non-rotating heavy massive models of {\textgreater} 80 Msun. We fit the stellar yields to the three most iron-deficient stars, and constrain the initial parameters of the mother progenitor stars. The abundance pattern in SMSS 0313-6708 is well explained by 50-80 Msun non-rotating models, rotating 30-40 Msun models well fit the abundance of HE 0107-5240, and both non-rotating and rotating 15-40 Msun models explain HE 1327-2326. The presented analysis will be applicable to other carbon-enhanced hyper metal poor stars observed in the future. The abundance analyses will give valuable information about the characteristics about the first stars.},

@article{Tam2012,
abstract = {Over the last few years, the fruitful data provided by the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has revolutionized our understanding of high-energy processes in globular clusters, particularly those involving compact objects like millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Gamma-ray emission between 100 MeV to 10 GeV has been detected from more than a dozen globular clusters in our Galaxy, most notably 47 Tucanae and Terzan 5. Based on a sample of known gamma-ray globular clusters, empirical relations between the gamma-ray luminosity and properties of globular clusters such as stellar encounter rate, metallicity, as well as optical and infrared photon energy density in the cluster, have been derived. The gamma-ray spectra are generally described by a power law with a cut-off at a few GeV. Together with the detection of pulsed gamma-rays from a millisecond pulsar in a globular cluster, such spectral signature gives support that gamma-rays from globular clusters are collective curvature emission from magnetospheres of MSPs within the cluster. Alternative models in which the inverse-Compton emission of relativistic electrons accelerated close to MSPs or the pulsar wind nebula shocks have also been suggested. Observations at {\textgreater}10 GeV by Fermi/LAT and atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes like H.E.S.S.-II, MAGIC-II, VERITAS, and CTA will help to settle some questions unanswered by current data. We also discuss TeV observations of globular clusters, as well as observational prospects of gravitational waves from double neutron stars in globular clusters.},

abstract = {Since their discovery in the late 1960's the population of known neutron stars (NSs) has grown to {\~{}}2500. The last five decades of observations have yielded many surprises and demonstrated that the observational properties of NSs are remarkably diverse. The surveys that will be performed with SKA (the Square Kilometre Array) will produce a further tenfold increase in the number of Galactic NSs known. Moreover, the SKA's broad spectral coverage, sub-arraying and multi-beaming capabilities will allow us to characterise these sources with unprecedented efficiency, in turn enabling a giant leap in the understanding of their properties. Here we review the NS population and outline our strategies for studying each of the growing number of diverse classes that are populating the "NS zoo". Some of the main scientific questions that will be addressed by the much larger statistical samples and vastly improved timing efficiency provided by SKA include: (i) the spin period and spin-down rate distributions (and thus magnetic fields) at birth, and the associated information about the SNe wherein they are formed; (ii) the radio pulsar-magnetar connection; (iii) the link between normal radio pulsars, intermittent pulsars and rotating radio transients; (iv) the slowest possible spin period for a radio pulsar (revealing the conditions at the pulsar death-line); (v) proper motions of pulsars (revealing SN kick physics); (vi) the mass distribution of NSs (vii) the fastest possible spin period for a recycled pulsar (constraining magnetosphere-accretion disc interactions, gravitational wave radiation and the equation-of-state); (viii) the origin of high eccentricity millisecond pulsars (MSPs); (ix) the formation channels for recently identified triple systems; and finally (x) how isolated MSPs are formed. We expect that the SKA will break new ground unveiling exotic systems that will challenge... [abridged]},

abstract = {The treatment of tangent curves is a powerful tool for analyzing and visual- izing the behavior of vector fields. Unfortunately, for sufficiently complicated vector fields, the tangent curves can only be implicitly described as the so- lution of a system of differential equations. In this work we show how to compute the curvature of tangent curves and discuss its usefulness for analyzing and visualizing vector fields. In particular, we investigate the curvature behavior around critical points. We show that the curvature of the tangent curves of a 2D vector field and its perpendicular vector field uniquely describe the vector directions in the vector field. We will also describe special curvature properties of linear vector fields in 2D. Applying the ideas of vector field curvature to vector fields over general parametrized surfaces, we are able to compute the curvature of particular tan- gent curves on a surface, such as contour lines, lines of curvature, asymptotic lines, isophotes and reflection lines. For special tangent curves, we introduce ”thickness” as another characteristic measure. We discuss the application of the curvature of tangent curves on surfaces as a surface interrogation tool. Finally, using the concepts of curvature of tangent curves, we deduce geometric conditions (necessary and sufficient) for G3 continuity of surfaces.},

abstract = {We consider the classical picture of three dimensional motion of charged particles in pulsar magnetosphere. We adopt a perturbative method to solve the equation of motion, and find the trajectory of particles as they move along the rotating dipolar magnetic field lines. Our aim is to study the influence of rotation on the pulsar radio emission by considering the constrained motion of particles along the open dipolar magnetic field lines. We find that the rotation induces a significant curvature into the particle trajectories. Our model predicts the intensity on leading side dominates over that of trailing side. We expect that if there is any curvature induced radio emission from the region close to the magnetic axis then it must be due to the rotation induced curvature. Our model predicts the radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) in the conal as well as core emissions.},

abstract = {We have developed a method to compute the possible distribution of radio emission regions in a typical pulsar magnetosphere, taking into account the viewing geometry and rotational effects of the neutron star. Our method can estimate the emission altitude and the radius of curvature of particle trajectory as a function of rotation phase for a given inclination angle, impact angle, spin period, Lorentz factor, field line constant and the observation frequency. Further, using curvature radiation as the basic emission mechanism, we simulate the radio intensity profiles that would be observed from a given distribution of emission regions, for different values of radio frequency and Lorentz factor. We show clearly that rotation effects can introduce significant asymmetries into the observed radio profiles. We investigate the dependency of profile features on various pulsar parameters. We find that the radiation from a given ring of field lines can be seen over a large range of pulse longitudes, originating at different altitudes, with varying spectral intensity. Preferred heights of emission along discrete sets of field lines are required to reproduce realistic pulsar profiles, and we illustrate this for a known pulsar. Finally, we show how our model provides feasible explanations for the origin of core emission, and also for one-sided cones which have been observed in some pulsars. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {We study electron-positron pair production in polar caps of energetic pulsars to determine the maximum multiplicity of pair plasma a pulsar can produce under the most favorable conditions. This paper complements and updates our study of pair cascades presented in Timokhin {\&} Harding (2015) with more accurate treatment of the effects of ultra strong B{\textgreater}3x10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}G magnetic fields and emission processes of primary and secondary particles. We include pairs produced by curvature and synchrotron radiation photons as well as resonant Compton scattered photons. We develop a semi-analytical model of electron-positrons cascades which can efficiently simulate pair cascades with an arbitrary number of microphysical processes and use it to explore cascade properties for a wide range of pulsar parameters. We argue that the maximum cascade multiplicity can not exceed {\~{}} a few x 10{\^{}}5 and the multiplicity has a rather weak dependence on pulsar period on pulsar period. The highest multiplicity is achieved in pulsars with magnetic field 4x10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\textless}B{\textless}10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}G and hot surfaces, with T{\textgreater}10{\^{}}6K. We also derive analytical expressions for several physical quantities relevant for electromagnetic cascade in pulsars which may be useful in future works on pulsar cascades, including the upper limit on cascade multiplicity and various approximations for the parameter $\backslash$chi, the exponential factor in the expression for photon attenuation in strong magnetic field.},

abstract = {We study the efficiency of pair production in polar caps of young pulsars under a variety of conditions to estimate the maximum possible multiplicity of pair plasma in pulsar magnetospheres. We develop a semi-analytic model for calculation of cascade multiplicity which allows efficient exploration of the parameter space and corroborate it with direct numerical simulations. Pair creation processes are considered separately from particle acceleration in order to assess different factors affecting cascade efficiency, with acceleration of primary particles described by recent self-consistent non-stationary model of pair cascades. We argue that the most efficient cascades operate in the curvature radiation/synchrotron regime, the maximum multiplicity of pair plasma in pulsar magnetospheres is {\~{}}few x 10{\^{}}5. The multiplicity of pair plasma in magnetospheres of young energetic pulsars weakly depends on the strength of the magnetic field and the radius of curvature of magnetic field lines and has a stronger dependence on pulsar inclination angle. This result questions assumptions about very high pair plasma multiplicity in theories of pulsar wind nebulae.},

@article{Ting2012,
abstract = {In preparation for the HERMES chemical tagging survey of about a million Galactic FGK stars, we estimate the number of independent dimensions of the space defined by the stellar chemical element abundances [X/Fe]. [...] We explore abundances in several environments, including solar neighbourhood thin/thick disk stars, halo metal-poor stars, globular clusters, open clusters, the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. [...] We find that, especially at low metallicity, the production of r-process elements is likely to be associated with the production of alpha-elements. This may support the core-collapse supernovae as the r-process site. We also verify the over-abundances of light s-process elements at low metallicity, and find that the relative contribution decreases at higher metallicity, which suggests that this lighter elements primary process may be associated with massive stars. [...] Our analysis reveals two types of core-collapse supernovae: one produces mainly alpha-elements, the other produces both alpha-elements and Fe-peak elements with a large enhancement of heavy Fe-peak elements which may be the contribution from hypernovae. [...] The extra contribution from low mass AGB stars at high metallicity compensates the dimension loss due to the homogenization of the core-collapse supernovae ejecta. [...] the number of independent dimensions of the [X/Fe]+[Fe/H] chemical space in the solar neighbourhood for HERMES is about 8 to 9. Comparing fainter galaxies and the solar neighbourhood, we find that the chemical space for fainter galaxies such as Fornax and the Large Magellanic Cloud has a higher dimensionality. This is consistent with the slower star formation history of fainter galaxies. [...]},

This is because we adopt the empirical relation that a larger amount of Fe is ejected by more massive HNe. Our results imply that the observed trends with small dispersions do not necessarily mean the rapid homogeneous mixing in the early galactic halo at [Fe/H] {\$}{\textless} -3{\$}, but can be reproduced by the ``inhomogeneous'' chemical evolution model. In addition, we examine how the modifications of the distributions of the electron mole fraction {\$}Y{\_}{\{}\backslashrm e{\}}{\$} and the density in the presupernova models improve the agreement with observations. In this connection, we discuss possible contributions of nucleosynthesis in the neutrino-driven wind and the accretion disk.},

Science targets range from exotic sources such as pulsars, to our Sun, to recently detected possible extragalactic bursts of radio emission, the so-called fast radio bursts (FRBs). Originally conceived purely as an imaging telescope, the initial design of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) did not include the ability to access high time and frequency resolution voltage data. However, the flexibility of the MWA's software correlator allowed an off-the-shelf solution for adding this capability. This paper describes the system that records the 100 mus and 10 kHz resolution voltage data from the MWA. Example science applications, where this capability is critical, are presented, as well as accompanying commissioning results from this mode to demonstrate verification.},

A total of 353 strong pulses were detected during eight hours of observing. The signal-to-noise ratios of the detected pulses range from 5 to 11.5. The peak fluxes of those pulses are 17 to 39 times that of the average pulse peak. The cumulative distribution of the signal-to-noise ratios of these strong pulses has a rough power-law distribution with a slope of 4.4 ± 0.5. Ten of the strong pulses arrived approximately 23 to 40 ms earlier than the average profile peak. This suggests the possibility that there are two strong pulse-emitting regions.},

abstract = {A statistical framework is presented for the study of the orthogonally polarized modes of radio pulsar emission via the covariances between the Stokes parameters. To accommodate the typically heavy-tailed distributions of single-pulse radio flux density, the fourth-order joint cumulants of the electric field are used to describe the superposition of modes with arbitrary probability distributions. The framework is used to consider the distinction between superposed and disjoint modes with particular attention to the effects of integration over finite samples. If the interval over which the polarization state is estimated is longer than the timescale for switching between two or more disjoint modes of emission, then the modes are unresolved by the instrument. The resulting composite sample mean exhibits properties that have been attributed to mode superposition, such as depolarization. Because the distinction between disjoint modes and a composite sample of unresolved disjoint modes depends on the temporal resolution of the observing instrumentation, the arguments in favour of superposed modes of pulsar emission are revisited and observational evidence for disjoint modes is described. In principle, the four-dimensional covariance matrix that describes the distribution of sample mean Stokes parameters can be used to distinguish between disjoint modes, superposed modes, and a composite sample of unresolved disjoint modes. More comprehensive and conclusive interpretation of the covariance matrix requires more detailed consideration of various relevant phenomena, including temporally correlated subpulse modulation (e.g. jitter), statistical dependence between modes (e.g. covariant intensities and partial coherence), and multipath propagation effects (e.g. scintillation and scattering).},

abstract = {Although only 22 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are currently known to exist in the globular cluster (GC) 47 Tucanae, this cluster may harbor 30-60 MSPs, or even up to {\~{}}200. In this Letter, we model the pulsed curvature radiation (CR) gamma-ray flux expected from a population of MSPs in 47 Tucanae. These MSPs produce gamma-rays in their magnetospheres via accelerated electron primaries which are moving along curved magnetic field lines. A GC like 47 Tucanae containing a large number of MSPs provides the opportunity to study a randomized set of pulsar geometries. Geometry-averaged spectra make the testing of the underlying pulsar model more reliable, since in this case the relative flux uncertainty is reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the variation expected for individual pulsars (if the number of visible pulsars N=100). Our predicted spectra violate the EGRET upper limit at 1 GeV, constraining the product of the number of visible pulsars N and the average integral flux above 1 GeV per pulsar. GLAST/LAT should place even more stringent constraints on this product, and may also limit the maximum average accelerating potential by probing the CR spectral tail. For N=22-200, a GLAST/LAT non-detection will lead to the constraints that the average integral flux per pulsar should be lower by factors 0.03-0.003 than current model predictions.},

The discrepancy between this measurement and a previously published parallax distance estimate is attributed to errors in the DE200 solar system ephemerides. The precise measurement of Pb˙ allows a limit on the variation of Newton's gravitational constant, |Ġ/G|{\textless}=23×10-12 yr-1. We also constrain any anomalous acceleration along the line of sight to the pulsar to |asolar/c|{\textless}=1.5×10-18 s-1 at 95{\%} confidence, and derive a pulsar mass, mpsr=1.76+/-0.20 Msolar, one of the highest estimates so far obtained.},

abstract = {The highly stable spin of neutron stars can be exploited for a variety of (astro-)physical investigations. In particular arrays of pulsars with rotational periods of the order of milliseconds can be used to detect correlated signals such as those caused by gravitational waves. Three such "Pulsar Timing Arrays" (PTAs) have been set up around the world over the past decades and collectively form the "International" PTA (IPTA). In this paper, we describe the first joint analysis of the data from the three regional PTAs, i.e. of the first IPTA data set. We describe the available PTA data, the approach presently followed for its combination and suggest improvements for future PTA research. Particular attention is paid to subtle details (such as underestimation of measurement uncertainty and long-period noise) that have often been ignored but which become important in this unprecedentedly large and inhomogeneous data set. We identify and describe in detail several factors that complicate IPTA research and provide recommendations for future pulsar timing efforts. The first IPTA data release presented here (and available online) is used to demonstrate the IPTA's potential of improving upon gravitational-wave limits placed by individual PTAs by a factor of {\~{}}2 and provides a 2-sigma limit on the dimensionless amplitude of a stochastic GWB of 1.7x10{\^{}}{\{}-15{\}} at a frequency of 1 yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}. This is 1.7 times less constraining than the limit placed by (Shannon et al. 2015), due mostly to the more recent, high-quality data they used.},

@article{Vivekanand1995,
abstract = {The recently upgraded Ooty Radio Telescope was used to observe pulse nulling in 10 pulsars. The fraction of time alpha that a pulsar spends in the nulled state is {\textless}=2.5 per cent for PSR 0149-16, {\textless}=7.0 per cent for PSR 0942-13 and 44.6+/-1.3 per cent for PSR 0031-07. The remaining seven alpha-values are consistent with previous estimates. This paper suggests an improved scheme of obtaining alpha for `weak' pulsars. In most pulsars, the width of the individual pulse is much smaller than that of the integrated pulse. The energy in a pulse can be best estimated by integrating the power over the width of the individual pulse, and not over that of the integrated pulse. An equivalent scheme involves summing up, from each individual pulse, a pre-determined number of extreme-valued powers. This significantly improves the accuracy of the nulling data. This method is used to obtain the statistics of the burst and null durations in PSR 0031-07. Both phenomena consist of at least two distinct random processes: (a) a short-time-scale process that can be represented by an exponential distribution with a width of {\~{}}=2.5 periods, and (b) a long-time-scale process that can be represented, for the burst phenomenon, by a Rayleigh distribution with a width of {\~{}}=24 periods. The duration of a burst is weakly correlated with that of the preceding null. The onset of a burst or a null is usually abrupt, but sometimes occurs over several periods. There is no significant difference between the average first and last pulses of a burst.},

abstract = {The pair of drifting subpulses of the radio pulsar PSR B0031-07 appear to be well separated from each other on average, overlapping at less than 1/30 of the peak energy. Strictly, the integrated profile of the pair (after removing the drift) does not show more than two subpulses; however, this result is likely to be modified with the availability of more data. On the other hand, rare instances of three simultaneous subpulses in a single period have been noticed. This is consistent with the Ruderman {\&} Sutherland model of the drifting phenomenon in which several sparks, uniformly spaced on a circle, rotate around the polar cap. The third subpulse appears to show up strongly when subpulses belonging to the primary drift bands weaken. Although this conclusion is based mainly on two reliable examples, it suggests an anticorrelation of the subpulse energies. The normalized correlation coefficient between the energies of the two subpulses in a period is -0.16+/-0.02, after accounting for a known selection effect. Simulations suggest that this result could not be an artifact. This suggests the idea of competing drifting subpulses which, if true, will have important ramifications for the growth and breakdown of the particle acceleration zones in pulsars.},

abstract = {The drifting behavior of PSR B0031-07 is studied using 40,205 periods of high-quality data obtained with the Ooty Radio Telescope, operating at 327 MHz. We confirm the three drift modes centered at slope $\alpha$ = -4.05, -7.78, and -11.46 ms period-1, in the proportion 15.6{\%}, 81.8{\%}, and 2.6{\%}, respectively. Strictly, the three drift modes are not harmonically related. The average subpulse energy and the rms position of the subpulse about the mean slope are both higher in the dominant drift mode, but the average subpulse width is independent of $\alpha$. The average subpulse profiles in the three drift modes are consistent with relativistic beaming. The average spacing P2 between two subpulses increases monotonically with | $\alpha$ | , contrary to the belief held so far that it is independent of | $\alpha$ | . The drift rate is enhanced at the edge of the integrated profile, which is apparently expected on the basis of the Ruderman {\&} Sutherland model. The average pulse energy during a null is at least 844 times less than that during a burst. This is much higher than the factor of {\~{}}100 that has been quoted so far. The integrated profiles in the three drift modes differ significantly from each other. These results (a) enhance the suspicion that the subpulse is the basic unit of radio emission in pulsars, (b) provide a possible model for mode changing in pulsars.},

A significant correlation was found  between the integrated degree of polarization and the loss of rotational  energy dot E. The data were also used to review the widely established  pulsar profile classification scheme of core- and cone-type beams.

abstract = {Cyclic spectroscopy is a signal processing technique that was originally developed for engineering applications and has recently been introduced into the field of pulsar astronomy. It is a powerful technique with many attractive features, not least of which is the explicit rendering of information about the relative phases in any filtering imposed on the signal, thus making holography a more straightforward proposition. Here we present methods for determining optimum estimates of both the filter itself and the statistics of the unfiltered signal, starting from a measured cyclic spectrum. In the context of radio pulsars these quantities tell us the impulse response of the interstellar medium and the intrinsic pulse profile. We demonstrate our techniques by application to 428 MHz Arecibo data on the millisecond pulsar B1937+21, obtaining the pulse profile free from the effects of interstellar scattering. As expected, the intrinsic profile exhibits main- and inter-pulse components that are narrower than they appear in the scattered profile; it also manifests some weak, but sharp features that are revealed for the first time at low frequency. We determine the structure of the received electric-field envelope as a function of delay and Doppler-shift. Our delay-Doppler image has a high dynamic-range and displays some pronounced, low-level power concentrations at large delays. These concentrations imply strong clumpiness in the ionized interstellar medium, on AU size-scales, which must adversely affect the timing of B1937+21.},

We have made 2-hour observations of 23 pulsars which showed evidence for pulse nulling or mode changing in the survey data. Because of the low flux density of these pulsars, in most cases averaging times of between 10 s and 60 s were necessary and so this analysis is insensitive to very short nulls. Seven of the pulsars had null fractions of more than 40{\%} with the largest having a lower limit of 95{\%}. Mode changes were observed in six pulsars with clear relationships between nulling and mode changing in some cases. Combined with earlier results, the data suggest that large null fractions are more related to large characteristic age than to long pulse period. The observations suggest that nulling and mode changing are different manifestations of the same phenomenon.},

abstract = {We present the results of a systematic, unbiased search for subpulse modulation of 187 pulsars performed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) in the Netherlands at an observing wavelength of 21 cm. Using new observations and archival WSRT data we have increased the list of pulsars that show the drifting subpulse phenomenon by 42, indicating that at least one in three pulsars exhibits this phenomenon. The real fraction of pulsars that show the drifting phenomenon is likely to be larger than 55{\%}. The majority of the analysed pulsars show subpulse modulation (170), of which the majority were not previously known to show subpulse modulation and 30 show clear systematic drifting. The large number of new drifters we have found allows us, for the first time, to do meaningful statistics on the drifting phenomenon. We find that the drifting phenomenon is correlated with the pulsar age such that drifting is more likely to occur in older pulsars. Pulsars that drift more coherently seem to be older and have a lower modulation index. There is no significant correlation found between P3 and other pulsar parameters (such as the pulsar age), as has been reported in the past. There is no significant preference of drift direction and the drift direction is not found to be correlated with pulsar parameters. None of the four complexity parameters predicted by different emission models are shown to be inconsistent with the set of modulation indices of our sample of pulsars. Therefore none of the models can be ruled out based on our observations. We also present results on some interesting new individual sources like a pulsar that shows similar subpulse modulation in both the main- and interpulse and six pulsars with opposite drift senses in different components.},

abstract = {Context: A large sample of pulsars has been observed to study their subpulse modulation at an observing wavelength (when achievable) of both 21 and 92 cm using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. In this paper we present the 92-cm data and a comparison is made with the already published 21-cm results. Aims: The main goals are to determine what fraction of the pulsars have drifting subpulses, whether those pulsars share some physical properties and to find out if subpulse modulation properties are frequency dependent. Methods: We analysed 191 pulsars at 92 cm searching for subpulse modulation using fluctuation spectra. The sample of pulsars is as unbiased as possible towards any particular pulsar characteristics. Results: For 15 pulsars drifting subpulses are discovered for the first time and 26 of the new drifters found in the 21-cm data are confirmed. We discovered nulling for 8 sources and 8 pulsars are found to intermittently emit single pulses that have pulse energies similar to giant pulses. Another pulsar was shown to exhibit a subpulse phase step. It is estimated that at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulses when observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available. It could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property of the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or impossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both frequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly slightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most disordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The modulation indices measured at the two frequencies are clearly correlated, although at 92 cm they are on average possibly higher. At 92 cm the modulation index appears to be correlated with the characteristic age of the pulsar and the complexity parameters as predicted by three different emission models. The correlations with the modulation indices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio emission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady signal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies. The measured values of P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, but there is no evidence for a correlation with other pulsar parameters.

abstract = {The usefulness and versatility of the PSRSALSA open-source pulsar data-analysis project is demonstrated through an analysis of the radio pulsar B1839-04. This study focuses on the phenomenon of bi-drifting, an effect where the drift direction of subpulses is systematically different in different pulse profile components. Bi-drifting is extremely rare in the pulsar population. Various tools in PSRSALSA, including those allowing quantification of periodicities in the subpulse modulation, their flux distribution, and polarization properties, are exploited to obtain a comprehensive picture of the radio properties of PSR B1839-04. In particular, the second harmonic in the fluctuation spectra of the subpulse modulation is exploited to convincingly demonstrate the existence of bi-drifting. Bi-drifting is confirmed with a completely independent method allowing the average modulation cycle to be determined. Polarization measurements were used to obtain a robust constraint on the magnetic inclination angle of less than 35 deg. Two distinct emission modes are discovered to be operating, with periodic subpulse modulation being present only during the weaker mode. Despite the variability of the modulation cycle and interruption by mode-changes, the modulation pattern responsible for the bi-drifting is strictly phase locked over a timescale of years such that the variability is identical in the different components. The phase locking implies that a single physical origin is responsible for both drift directions. Phase locking is hard to explain for many models, including those specifically proposed in the literature to explain bi-drifting, and they are therefore shown to be implausible. It is argued that within the framework of circulating beamlets, bi-drifting could occur if the circulation were severely distorted, possibly by distortions in the magnetic field.},

abstract = {The observed fraction of pulsars with interpulses, their period distribution and the observed pulse width versus pulse period correlation are shown to be inconsistent with a model in which the angle between the magnetic axis and the rotation axis is random. This conclusion appears to be unavoidable, even when non-circular beams are considered. Allowing the magnetic axis to align from a random distribution at birth with a time-scale of [{\~{}}]7 x 107 yr can, however, explain those observations well. The time-scale derived is consistent with that obtained via independent methods. The probability that a pulsar beam intersects the line of sight is a function of the angle and therefore beam evolution has important consequences for evolutionary models and for estimations of the total number of neutron stars. The validity of the standard formula for the spin-down rate, which is independent of , appears to be questionable.},

abstract = {We present a geometric study of the radio and [gamma]-ray pulsar B1055-52 based on recent observations at the Parkes radio telescope. We conclude that the pulsar's magnetic axis is inclined at an angle of 75 degrees to its rotation axis and that both its radio main pulse and interpulse are emitted at the same height above their respective poles. This height is unlikely to be higher or much lower than 700 km, a typical value for radio pulsars. It is argued that the radio interpulse arises from emission formed on open fieldlines close to the magnetic axis which do not pass through the magnetosphere's null (zero-charge) surface. However, the main pulse emission must originate from fieldlines lying well outside the polar cap boundary beyond the null surface, and farther away from the magnetic axis than those of the outer gap region where the single [gamma]-ray peak is generated. This casts doubt on the common assumption that all pulsars have closed, quiescent, corotating regions stretching to the light cylinder. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Unfortunately, in spite of their increasing sophistication, numerical models of Pop III star formation cannot yet predict the masses of the first stars. Because they lie at the edge of the observable universe, individual Pop III stars will also remain beyond the reach of telescopes for the foreseeable future, and so their properties remain unknown. However, it will soon be possible to constrain their masses by the direct detection of their supernovae and by reconciling their nucleosynthetic yields to the chemical abundances measured in ancient metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo, some of which may be bear the ashes of the first stars. Here, I review current problems on the simulation frontier in Pop III star formation and discuss the best prospects for constraining their properties observationally in the near term.},

abstract = {Understanding the properties of Pop III stars is prerequisite to elucidating the nature of primeval galaxies, the chemical enrichment and reionization of the early IGM, and the origin of supermassive black holes. While the primordial IMF remains unknown, recent evidence from numerical simulations and stellar archaeology suggests that some Pop III stars may have had lower masses than previously thought, 15 - 50 $\backslash$Ms in addition to 50 - 500 $\backslash$Ms. The detection of Pop III supernovae by JWST, WFIRST or the TMT could directly probe the primordial IMF for the first time. We present numerical simulations of 15 - 40 $\backslash$Ms Pop III core-collapse SNe done with the Los Alamos radiation hydrodynamics code RAGE. We find that they will be visible in the earliest galaxies out to z {\~{}} 10 - 15, tracing their star formation rates and in some cases revealing their positions on the sky. Since the central engines of Pop III and solar-metallicity core-collapse SNe are quite similar, future detection of any Type II supernovae by next-generation NIR instruments will in general be limited to this epoch.},

@article{Wright2003,
abstract = {A pulsar model is proposed which involves the entire magnetosphere in the production of the observed coherent radio emission. The observationally inferred regularity of peaks in the pulsar profiles of `slow' pulsars is shown to suggest that inner and outer cones of emission near the polar cap interact with and `mirror' two rings in the outer magnetosphere: one where the null line intersects the light cylinder, and another where it intersects the boundary of the corotating dead zone. The observed dependency of conal type on period is shown to follow naturally from the assumption that cones only form when the mirror intersection points lie between two fixed heights from the surface, suggesting that a feedback system exists between the surface and the mirror points, accomplished by a flow of charges of opposite sign in either direction. In their flow to and from the mirror points, the particles execute an azimuthal drift around the magnetic pole, thereby creating a ring of discrete `emission nodes' close to the surface. Motion of the nodes is observed as subpulse `drift', which is interpreted here as a small residual component of the real particle drift. The nodes can move in either direction or even remain stationary, and can differ in the inner and outer cones. A precise fit is found for the drifting subpulses of PSR 0943+10. Azimuthal interactions between different regions of the magnetosphere depend on the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes and influence the conal type, as observed. The model sees `slow' pulsars as being at the end of an evolutionary development where the outer gap region no longer produces pair cascades, but is still the intermittent source of low-energy pairs in a magnetosphere-wide feedback system.},

abstract = {For many years it has been considered puzzling how pulsar radio emission, supposedly created by a circulating carousel of sub-beams, can produce the driftbands demonstrated by PSR J0815+09, and more recently PSR B1839-04, which simultaneously drift in opposing directions. Here we suggest that the carousels of these pulsars, and hence their beams, are not circular but elliptical with axes tilted with respect to the fiducial plane. We show that certain relatively unusual lines of sight can cause bi-drifting to be observed, and a simulation of the two known exemplars is presented. Although bi-drifting is rare, non-circular beams may be common among pulsars and reveal themselves by having profile centroids displaced from the fiducial plane identified by polarisation position angle swings. They may also result in profiles with asymmetric and frequency-dependent component evolution. It is further suggested that the carousels may change their tilt by specific amounts and later reverse them. This may occur suddenly, accompanying a mode change (e.g. PSR B0943+10), or more gradually and short-lived as in "flare" pulsars (e.g. PSR B1859+07). A range of pulsar behaviour (e.g. the shifting drift patterns of PSRs B0818-41 and B0826-34) may also be the result of non-circular carousels with varying orientation. The underlying nature of these carousels - whether they are exclusively generated by polar cap physics or driven by magnetospheric effects - is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {In re-analyzing the archival Chandra data of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, we have detected a new diffuse X-ray emission feature within the half-mass radius of the cluster. The spectrum of the diffuse emission can be described by a power-law model plus a plasma component with photon index {\$}\backslashGamma\backslashsim1.0{\$} and plasma temperature {\$}kT\backslashsim0.2{\$} keV. While the thermal component is apparently uniform, the non-thermal contribution falls off exponentially from the core. The observed properties could possibly be explained in the context of multiple shocks resulted from the collisions among the stellar wind in the cluster and the inverse Compton scattering between the pulsar wind and the relic photons.},

abstract = {The Murchison Widefield Array, and its recently developed Voltage Capture System, facilitates extending the low-frequency range of pulsar observations at high-time and -frequency resolution in the Southern Hemisphere, providing further information about pulsars and the ISM. We present the results of an initial time-resolved census of known pulsars using the Murchison Widefield Array. To significantly reduce the processing load, we incoherently sum the detected powers from the 128 Murchison Widefield Array tiles, which yields {\~{}}10{\%} of the attainable sensitivity of the coherent sum. This preserves the large field-of-view ({\~{}}450 deg 2 at 185 MHz), allowing multiple pulsars to be observed simultaneously. We developed a WIde-field Pulsar Pipeline that processes the data from each observation and automatically folds every known pulsar located within the beam. We have detected 50 pulsars to date, 6 of which are millisecond pulsars. This is consistent with our expectation, given the telescope sensitivity and the sky coverage of the processed data ({\~{}}17 000 deg 2 ). For 10 pulsars, we present the lowest frequency detections published. For a subset of the pulsars, we present multi-frequency pulse profiles by combining our data with published profiles from other telescopes. Since the Murchison Widefield Array is a low-frequency precursor to the Square Kilometre Array, we use our census results to forecast that a survey using the low-frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array Phase 1 can potentially detect around 9 400 pulsars.},

abstract = {Polarization profiles are presented for 20 millisecond pulsars that are being observed as part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project. The observations used the Parkes multibeam receiver with a central frequency of 1369 MHz and the Parkes digital filterbank pulsar signal-processing system PDFB2. Because of the large total observing time, the summed polarization profiles have very high signal/noise ratios and show many previously undetected profile features. Thirteen of the 20 pulsars show emission over more than half of the pulse period. Polarization variations across the profiles are complex and the observed position angle variations are generally not in accord with the rotating-vector model for pulsar polarization. Never-the-less, the polarization properties are broadly similar to those of normal (non-millisecond) pulsars, suggesting that the basic radio emission mechanism is the same in both classes of pulsar. The results support the idea that radio emission from millisecond pulsars originates high in the pulsar magnetosphere, probably close to the emission regions for high-energy X-ray and gamma-ray emission. Rotation measures were obtained for all 20 pulsars, eight of which had no previously published measurements.},

abstract = {Pulsar nulling is a phenomenon of sudden cessation of pulse emission for a number of periods. The nulling fraction was often used to characterize the phenomenon. We propose a new method to analyse pulsar nulling phenomenon, by involving two key parameters, the nulling degree, {\$}\backslashchi{\$}, which is defined as the angle in a rectangular coordinates for the numbers of nulling periods and bursting periods, and the nulling scale, {\$} N {\$}, which is defined as the effective length of the consecutive nulling periods and bursting periods. The nulling degree {\$}\backslashchi{\$} can be calculated by {\$}\backslashtan \backslashchi = N{\_}{\{}\backslashrm nulling{\}} / N{\_}{\{}\backslashrm bursting{\}} {\$} and the mean is related to the nulling fraction, while the nulling scale, {\$} N {\$}, is also a newly defined fundamental parameter which indicates how often the nulling occurs. We determined the distributions of {\$}\backslashchi{\$} and {\$} N {\$} for 10 pulsars by using the data in literature. We found that the nulling degree {\$}\backslashchi{\$} indicates the relative length of nulling to that of bursting, and the nulling scale {\$} N {\$} is found to be related to the derivative of rotation frequency and hence the loss rate of rotational energy of pulsars. Their deviations reflect the randomness of the nulling process.},

abstract = {A standard model for the visibility of pulsar radio emission is based on the assumption that the emission is confined to a narrow cone about the tangent to a dipolar field line. The widely accepted rotating vector model (RVM) is an approximation in which the line of sight is fixed and the field line is not strictly tangent to it. We refer to an exact treatment (Gangadhara 2004) as the tangent model. In the tangent model (but not in the RVM) the visible point changes as a function of pulsar rotational phase, {\$}\backslashpsi{\$}, defining a trajectory on a sphere of radius {\$}r{\$}. We solve for the trajectory and for the angular velocity of the visible point around it. We note the recent claim that this motion is observable using interstellar holography (Pen et al. 2014). We estimate the error introduced by use of the RVM and find that it is significant for pulsars with emission over a wide range of {\$}\backslashpsi{\$}. The RVM tends to underestimate the range of {\$}\backslashpsi{\$} over which emission is visible. We suggest that the geometry alone strongly favors the visible pulsar radio being emitted at a heights more than ten percent of the light-cylinder distance, where our neglect of retardation effects becomes significant.},

abstract = {We develop a model for subpulse separation period, {\$}P{\_}2{\$}, taking into account both the apparent motion of the visible point as a function of pulsar phase, {\$}\backslashpsi{\$}, and the possibility of abrupt jumps between different rotation states in non-corotating pulsar magnetospheres. We identify three frequencies: (i) the spin frequency of the star, (ii) the drift frequency of the magnetospheric plasma in the source region, and (iii) the angular frequency of the visible point around its trajectory. We show how the last of these, which is neglected in traditional models by implicitly assuming the line of sight through the center of the star, affects the interpretation of {\$}P{\_}2{\$}. We attribute the subpulse structure to emission from {\$}m{\$} anti-nodes distributed uniformly in azimuthal angle about the magnetic axis. We show that variations of {\$}P{\_}2{\$} as a function of rotational phase or observing frequency arise naturally when the motion of the visible point is taken into account. We discuss possible application of our model in signifying overall field-line distortion at the emitting region. Abrupt changes in {\$}P{\_}2{\$} can occur during state switching in the magnetosphere. We demonstrate that the unique value of {\$}P{\_}2{\$} in each rotation state can be used, in principle, to relate the rotation state of the magnetospheres to subpulse drifting.},

@article{Yuki2012,
abstract = {To explain the pulsed emission of the rotation powered pulsars from radio to gamma-ray, polar cap models, slot gap models, and outer gap models are proposed. Recent observations suggest that these models are likely to co-exist in the same magnetosphere. If so, their mutual relation is known to be troublesome (Harding 2009), due to the boundary conditions and the direction of the current, which are properly assumed in each acceleration model. We performed a particle simulation for the global magnetospheric structure. Based on this simulation, we present a new picture of the global structure of the pulsar magnetosphere. It is found that a new dead zone is formed along the current neutral line that separates the oppositely directed current. We shall call this the current-neutral zone. We suggest that the polar cap accelerators and the slot gaps locate above the current-neutral zone, and the outer gap exist between the current neutral zone and the traditional dead zone. We also give an estimate of the super-rotation region.},
